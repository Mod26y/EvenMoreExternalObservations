**1) What happened:** OpenAI has announced that their advanced AI tool, "Deep Research," which was initially available only to Plus and Enterprise subscribers, is set to be rolled out to free users of ChatGPT. Deep Research acts as an independent AI agent, conducting in-depth information retrieval, analysis, and verification across the internet based on user prompts. While currently limited to 10 queries per month for Plus users, details about the exact scope and availability for free users are yet to be revealed.

**2) Why it matters:** The introduction of Deep Research to ChatGPT's free users signifies a democratization of powerful AI tools, potentially enhancing access to comprehensive data and research capabilities for individuals and organizations without financial constraints. This development could significantly influence sectors reliant on in-depth research, such as academia, journalism, and business, by providing a more efficient means to gather and verify information. However, it also raises potential cybersecurity and data privacy concerns with increased usage and reliance on AI-powered research processes.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:** The County's information security steering committee should evaluate the implications of using AI-powered tools like Deep Research within their systems, focusing on data security and compliance with privacy laws. Training sessions can be organized to familiarize staff with the tool's functionalities and the importance of safeguarding sensitive data when using AI for research. Furthermore, it may be prudent to develop guidelines on the ethical use of AI in research to prevent misinformation and maintain trust in the findings generated by such tools.
