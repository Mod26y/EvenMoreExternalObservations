**What happened:**  
Microsoft used its AI tool, Security Copilot, to identify 20 previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in open-source bootloaders GRUB2, U-Boot, and Barebox. These vulnerabilities include buffer overflows and integer overflows, affecting the security of devices relying on these bootloaders. GRUB2 is widely used in Linux distributions, while U-Boot and Barebox are prevalent in embedded and IoT devices. Although physical access is often required to exploit U-Boot and Barebox vulnerabilities, GRUB2 flaws can allow bypassing Secure Boot protections, leading to potential bootkit installations or bypassing other security mechanisms like BitLocker.

**Why it matters:**  
The discovery of these vulnerabilities is crucial, as bootloaders are fundamental to device security. Exploiting them could allow attackers to bypass critical security mechanisms and install persistent malware, maintaining control even after system reinstalls. GRUB2 vulnerabilities could pose a broader threat due to its prevalent use in Linux systems. This incident highlights the ongoing security challenges in open-source software and underscores the potential of AI tools in efficiently identifying complex vulnerabilities within large codebases, thus accelerating mitigation efforts.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**  
Organizations should prioritize updating systems to the latest versions of GRUB2, U-Boot, and Barebox, which have been patched against these vulnerabilities as of February 2025. It's crucial for security teams to incorporate AI-driven tools like Microsoft's Security Copilot into their vulnerability management programs to enhance their ability to identify and mitigate potential threats swiftly. Additionally, reinforcing security practices, such as limiting physical access to critical devices and continuously monitoring for unusual activities, should form part of an organization's comprehensive security strategy.
