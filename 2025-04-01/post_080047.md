**What happened:**  
The article reports on a sophisticated phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform called 'Lucid,' which is operated by the XinXin group. Lucid targets iOS and Android users globally using iMessage and RCS to bypass traditional spam filters. Selling access via a subscription model on a Telegram channel, it boasts over 1,000 phishing domains and robust spam tools. The group sends around 100,000 smishing messages daily, utilizing device farms and exploiting technology flaws to deliver phishing campaigns effectively and cost-efficiently. These messages often impersonate reputable entities, aiming to steal personal and financial information.

**Why it matters:**  
Lucid represents a significant threat due to its scale and the sophistication of its evasion techniques. By leveraging platforms like iMessage and RCS, it exploits end-to-end encryption to bypass spam filters, facilitating mass distribution that can affect a broad audience. This lowers the entry barrier to cybercrime while increasing the effectiveness of phishing attacks. The theft of personal and financial details can have severe implications for individuals and organizations alike, leading to financial fraud, identity theft, and other forms of cybercrime.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations should enhance awareness and training regarding smishing threats, emphasizing the risks associated with unexpected messages urging link clicks. Implementing email and SMS filtering systems that can recognize and block suspicious activity despite encryption can add protection layers. Encouraging users to verify alerts through official channels and strengthening multi-factor authentication measures can also help mitigate risks. Finally, maintaining updated cybersecurity policies and incident response strategies will improve resilience against emerging threats like Lucid.
