**1) What happened?**

The DollyWay malware campaign has compromised over 20,000 WordPress sites since 2016, primarily redirecting users to malicious sites to generate fraudulent impressions. Evolving significantly, the operation now employs complex evasion, re-infection, and monetization methods, using n-day flaws in WordPress plugins and themes. The campaign, linked to affiliate networks like VexTrio and LosPollos, uses a Traffic Direction System (TDS) to filter and redirect traffic. Auto-reinfection and hidden admin accounts complicate site disinfection. The operation's persistence and sophistication are highlighted by its ability to avoid detection and maintain access through various obfuscation techniques.

**2) Why it matters?**

This ongoing campaign highlights the vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins and themes frequently targeted by cybercriminals. The scale of infection reflects a significant threat to website integrity and user safety. By utilizing advanced techniques for persistence and evasion, DollyWay underscores the need for robust cybersecurity measures, especially for commonly-used platforms like WordPress. The campaign's monetization through affiliate networks signifies a coordinated effort in cybercrime, emphasizing the importance for organizations to not only protect their sites but also to understand the tactics employed by attackers to safeguard against future breaches.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Organizations using WordPress should prioritize updating their plugins and themes to close potential security gaps. It's essential to conduct regular security audits and use tools to detect unauthorized admin accounts and hidden malicious plugins. Implementing robust intrusion detection systems can help identify unusual behaviors indicative of malware activity. Furthermore, sharing the indicators of compromise (IoCs) provided by GoDaddy with security teams would enhance the ability to recognize and counteract this threat. Lastly, educating users on secure web practices and ensuring that passive scanning tools are complemented by interaction-based detection systems could help mitigate infection risks.
