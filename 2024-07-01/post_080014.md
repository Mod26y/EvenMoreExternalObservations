### What Happened

Google is developing a feature for Chrome called "Unrestricted WebUSB," which allows trusted isolated web apps to bypass certain security restrictions that usually prevent access to sensitive USB devices. The WebUSB API, designed to let web applications interact with local USB devices, typically blocks access to various protected interface classes and specific USB devices such as security keys. The new feature, set for testing in Chrome 128, will allow isolated web apps with special permissions to access these restricted devices, provided they meet certain conditions.

### Why It Matters

This development is significant because it balances the need for greater functionality in web applications with the need for security. While traditional WebUSB restrictions are designed to prevent potential attacks from malicious scripts, the new feature allows trusted isolated web apps—often used for internal company purposes—to access more sensitive USB devices and interfaces. This could enhance productivity and enable more sophisticated web applications. However, it also introduces potential security risks, as circumventing existing protections could expose vulnerable areas if permissions are mismanaged or if the apps themselves are compromised.

### What Actions Should Be Taken

Organizations should prepare by reviewing internal policies and access controls around the use of isolated web apps and sensitive USB devices. Security teams need to assess whether the benefits of enabling broader USB device access in specific web applications outweigh the risks. Additionally, stringent testing and vetting of any web apps granted "usb-unrestricted" permissions are essential. Monitoring and logging access to these devices will be crucial for detecting and responding to any unauthorized attempts promptly. Finally, staying updated with security patches and updates from Google will help mitigate potential vulnerabilities as the feature becomes widely available.
