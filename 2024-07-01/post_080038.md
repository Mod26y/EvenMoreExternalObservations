### What Happened

The Ambulatory Surgery Center of Westchester (ASCW) experienced a data security incident involving unauthorized access to an employee's email account. Discovered on November 3, 2023, the breach took place between October 23, 2023, and November 3, 2023. Upon identifying unusual activity, ASCW secured the account and enlisted a forensic and incident response team to investigate. The compromised data included names, Social Security numbers, state identification numbers, dates of birth, medical records, health insurance information, and financial details. Notification to affected individuals was sent on June 26, 2024.

### Why It Matters

This incident is significant due to its impact on personal and sensitive information concerning both current and former employees and patients. The breach’s scope—encompassing social security numbers, medical records, and financial data—heightens the risk for identity theft, medical fraud, and financial loss. Given the sensitivity of healthcare data, this breach undermines trust in ASCW’s ability to protect patient information and may lead to regulatory scrutiny, financial penalties, and reputational damage.

### Recommended Actions

In light of this incident, the steering committee could consider further strengthening email and network security protocols, including multi-factor authentication, regular audits, and real-time monitoring for unusual activities. Employee training on recognizing phishing attempts and proper email security practices might reduce future risks. Additionally, periodic third-party risk assessments and penetration testing could help identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Ensuring transparent communication and offering credit monitoring services to affected individuals could also help in managing the potential fallout from the breach.
