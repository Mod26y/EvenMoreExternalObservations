**What happened:**  
It seems there was an attempt to access an article titled "Transforming Cyber Frameworks to Take Control of Cyber-Risk" on Dark Reading's website, but a 403 error occurred, indicating access was forbidden. This error suggests that the webpage might have restrictions, such as requiring a subscription, being regionally blocked, or other security protocols that restrict access to unauthorized users. The article in question likely discusses the evolution or transformation of cybersecurity frameworks designed to enhance control over cyber risks.

**Why it matters:**  
The relevance of this issue stems from the constant need to evolve cybersecurity frameworks to effectively address and manage emerging cyber threats. As cyber risks continue to grow in complexity and frequency, organizations must adapt their security strategies accordingly to protect sensitive data and ensure resilience against attacks. Understanding current shifts in cybersecurity frameworks matters as it aids organizations in reshaping their policies and practices to enhance cybersecurity postures and mitigate risks more effectively.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**  
To leverage insights potentially discussed in the inaccessible article, the committee should explore other credible sources detailing contemporary approaches to cyber-risk management frameworks. Engaging with cybersecurity experts, attending relevant conferences, and participating in industry forums can offer valuable perspectives. Moreover, reviewing and adapting existing cybersecurity frameworks, such as NIST or ISO/IEC 27001, in light of new developments ensures they remain robust. The county should also consider fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation to effectively manage evolving cyber risks.
