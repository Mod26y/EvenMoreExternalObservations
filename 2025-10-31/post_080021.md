**1) What happened:**  
A massive increase in NFC relay malware is occurring in Eastern Europe, specifically targeting Android devices. Over 760 malicious apps using the technique have been discovered. Unlike traditional banking trojans, this malware uses Android's Host Card Emulation (HCE) to illicitly capture contactless credit card and payment information. The malware mimics legitimate transactions by manipulating EMV fields and responding to APDU commands at Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals, allowing payments without the cardholder's presence. Initially identified in Poland in 2023, the attacks have spread to countries including the Czech Republic and Russia, utilizing data-harvesting apps, relay toolkits, and fake bank apps.

**2) Why it matters:**  
The rise of NFC relay malware poses significant threats to financial security, particularly as it exploits growing contactless payment technologies. Its capacity to operate without the cardholderâ€™s presence increases the risk of unauthorized transactions and financial theft. With over 760 malicious apps identified, users in Eastern Europe are heavily targeted, risking exposure to these sophisticated attacks. Such threats highlight vulnerabilities in mobile payment systems and underscore the need for heightened security measures and user awareness to prevent financial loss and protect sensitive payment data.

**3) What actions should be taken:**  
To mitigate the threat of NFC relay malware, Android users should avoid installing APKs from outside trusted sources like Google Play. Users should only download banking apps through verified bank websites and be cautious of apps requesting NFC or excessive permissions. Regularly scanning devices with Play Protect, Android's anti-malware feature, and disabling NFC when not needed can also enhance security. Organizations should update security protocols to detect and respond to such threats, and raise awareness about identifying and avoiding malicious apps to protect users' data and financial information.
