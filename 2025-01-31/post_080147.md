The article discusses how scammers are exploiting the likeness of Monica Geingos, Namibia's former first lady, to perpetrate investment scams. These scams involve creating fake social media accounts and manipulated videos purporting to show Geingos endorsing fraudulent investment schemes. This trend follows a broader pattern of impersonation scams across Africa, targeting individuals by leveraging the influence of public figures.

This issue matters because it highlights vulnerabilities faced by populations with limited digital literacy and scrutinizes the challenges of cross-border cybercrime. The scams are causing significant financial harm to victims, including loss of retirement savings. It also underscores the difficulties governments face in protecting citizens against sophisticated impersonation techniques and the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity measures and education.

In response to this situation, it would be recommended to increase public awareness campaigns to educate people about recognizing and avoiding impersonation scams. Strengthening digital literacy programs can further empower citizens to critically assess online information. Law enforcement and international cooperation should focus on enhancing capabilities to track and dismantle scam networks. Collaboration with technology platforms can also help detect and remove fraudulent accounts efficiently.
