1) Without access to the full article, the title suggests that ECH (Encrypted ClientHello) adoption is currently low but presents ongoing risks for enterprises and end-users. ECH is a security protocol enhancement designed to improve privacy by encrypting part of the TLS handshake process. Limited adoption implies that many organizations are not implementing or benefiting from these enhanced privacy protocols, potentially leaving communication data exposed to surveillance or attacks that could have been mitigated by ECH.

2) This low adoption rate is significant because it highlights a gap in privacy protection for both enterprises and end-users. Without widespread ECH implementation, sensitive data transmitted over TLS protocols can be intercepted or manipulated during the handshake process. For enterprises, this represents a substantial security and privacy risk, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access. End-users can also face increased risks of privacy invasion and data exploitation if their communications are not adequately encrypted.

3) Organizations might consider evaluating their current encryption protocols and plan upgrades to incorporate ECH where feasible, enhancing both privacy and data security. They could also engage in educational initiatives to understand the benefit of ECH and advocate for its adoption within industry standards. Keeping abreast of cybersecurity developments and participating in collaborative forums to influence broader adoption practices might also prove beneficial in advancing overall security posture.
