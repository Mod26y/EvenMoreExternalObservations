**1) What happened:**

Operation Undercut is a malign influence campaign orchestrated by the Social Design Agency (SDA) in Russia, paralleling past operations like Doppelgänger. This campaign aims to destabilize Western alliances by eroding support for Ukraine amidst its ongoing conflict with Russia. It exploits AI-enhanced videos on social media to disseminate disinformation, falsely depicting events and stances related to Ukraine, US politics, and other sensitive global matters. Despite its limited audience engagement, the US government has been proactive against these operations, exemplified by efforts to seize domains associated with Doppelgänger.

**2) Why it matters:**

This campaign represents a broader Russian strategy to undermine Western unity and influence international perceptions, aiming to sway public opinion and policy against supporting Ukraine. It leverages advanced tools like AI for crafting and spreading misleading content, which could have serious implications on political dynamics and public trust in media. Given its influence on significant geopolitical events, such as the upcoming US elections and the Middle East conflict, it poses a genuine threat to national security and democratic processes, necessitating vigilant monitoring and countermeasures.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

To combat this form of digital interference, strengthening monitoring and rapid response systems against disinformation campaigns remains crucial. This involves intelligence sharing between government agencies and cooperation with social media platforms to identify and dismantle these networks swiftly. Enhancing public awareness and media literacy is essential to reducing susceptibility to such campaigns. Investing in AI technologies to detect and counter falsified content before it gains traction can also play a pivotal role. Policymakers might also consider updating legislation to impose stricter consequences for foreign interference in digital spaces.
