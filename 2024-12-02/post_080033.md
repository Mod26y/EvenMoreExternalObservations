**What Happened:** Bologna Football Club 1909 experienced a ransomware attack from the RansomHub extortion group, which led to the theft and subsequent online leaking of the club's sensitive data. This breach includes personal and confidential data of players, sponsorship contracts, financial records, and other critical information. The attack took place on November 19, 2024, following the clubâ€™s refusal to meet the extortion demands. RansomHub threatened and eventually published the compromised data on the dark web after granting and then retracting an extension deadline for ransom payment negotiations.

**Why It Matters:** This incident highlights the vulnerability of sports teams, which often manage extensive financial and personal data, to ransomware attacks. Such breaches can lead to severe reputational damage, financial loss, and legal complications, especially regarding the potential misuse of leaked data. The situation underscores the growing trend of cybercriminals targeting organizations associated with significant financial dealings and public profiles. It also serves as a reminder of the risks associated with non-compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR, potentially resulting in fines and further liabilities.

**Actions to be Taken:** Organizations should bolster their cybersecurity measures, focusing on threat intelligence, employee training, and regular security audits. It would be prudent to develop robust incident response and communication plans to quickly mitigate and manage breaches. Engaging with cyber insurance could help manage potential financial losses. Legal counsel should be consulted to ensure compliance with data protection laws, and efforts should be made to secure sensitive information, perhaps through enhanced encryption and access controls, to minimize damage if a breach occurs.
