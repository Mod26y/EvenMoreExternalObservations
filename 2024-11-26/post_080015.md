Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/new-windows-10-0x80073cfa-fix-requires-installing-winappsdk-3-times/

**1) What happened:**  
Microsoft has identified a bug affecting Windows 10 users who received the WinAppSDK 1.6.2 update, preventing them from uninstalling or updating certain packaged applications like Microsoft Teams. This issue results in a "Something happened on our end" error via the Microsoft Store and a 0x80073CFA error in PowerShell for IT administrators. In response, Microsoft has pulled the problematic update and provided an alternative fix involving installing the newer WinAppSDK 1.6.3 update three times, avoiding the optional cumulative preview update released earlier.

**2) Why it matters:**  
This issue impacts Windows 10 users who depend on Microsoft Store applications and IT administrators who manage these packaged apps. Problems with the software deployment stack can escalate into operational inefficiencies and user frustration. Moreover, recurring software issues can cause concerns regarding Windows updates' stability and reliability. Since some users avoid optional updates, alternative fixes are crucial for maintaining system functionality and application management without exposing systems to potential update-related risks.

**3) What actions should be taken:**  
Affected users and IT administrators can execute the provided PowerShell command to check for the presence of the buggy WinAppSDK 1.6.2. If identified, they should follow Microsoft's advice to install the WinAppSDK 1.6.3 update three times to address application uninstall and update issues. IT departments might also benefit from monitoring Microsoft's communications for updates on this and other issues and implementing a cautious approach when applying new updates. Enhanced testing and staging of updates before wider deployment could mitigate the risk of disruption.
