### What Happened

Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS) and ISC2 have launched the WiCyS + ISC2 Certified in CybersecuritySM Certification Fall Camp, aimed at providing cybersecurity education and certification to underrepresented populations. The camp will run from September 12 to October 12, offering training across five key security domains. The program includes mentorship, self-paced online training, and open office hours. Top performers will receive scholarships to the 2025 WiCyS annual conference. Applications are open until August 20, 2024. This initiative follows a successful Spring Camp where over 100 women earned certifications.

### Why It Matters

This initiative addresses the significant talent gap in the cybersecurity industry by making education and certification more accessible to underrepresented groups, including women. As cyber threats continue to evolve and escalate, a diverse and well-trained workforce is crucial for developing innovative solutions and ensuring a robust cybersecurity posture. By fostering inclusivity and offering targeted support, the program not only strengthens the immediate talent pool but also contributes to long-term industry resilience and diversity, which are essential for tackling emerging cybersecurity challenges effectively.

### Actions to be Taken

The county's information security steering committee should consider promoting similar inclusive and supportive training programs within local educational institutions and organizations. Collaboration with entities like WiCyS and ISC2 could also be explored to provide specialized training and mentorship, ensuring the development of a diverse cybersecurity workforce. Additionally, the committee might evaluate current hiring practices to enhance diversity and inclusion, which can lead to innovative approaches in tackling cybersecurity threats. Finally, establishing continuous professional development initiatives could help retain and grow talent within the countyâ€™s cybersecurity teams.
