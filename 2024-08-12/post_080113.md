### What Happened

Researchers from Bitdefender discovered critical vulnerabilities within the cloud APIs of two widely used solar power management platforms, Solarman and Deye Cloud, potentially allowing attackers to disrupt parts of connected power grids. These vulnerabilities could enable unauthorized third parties to change inverter settings, alter how these devices interact with the grid, and access sensitive information. While various endpoints could be exploited for malicious purposes, both companies have since addressed the reported vulnerabilities.

### Why It Matters

This situation underscores significant cybersecurity risks in critical infrastructure. Solar power installations are crucial for the global energy grid. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could destabilize electrical grids, leading to service disruptions or power loss. Moreover, unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as GPS coordinates and real-time production data, raises substantial concerns about user privacy and potential misuse. Given the widespread deployment of these systems globally, these vulnerabilities represent a threat to both national security and individual privacy.

### Actions to Be Taken

Organizations utilizing Solarman or Deye Cloud platforms should conduct a thorough review and audit of their systems for any residual vulnerabilities. Implementing enhanced security measures such as more robust authentication protocols, and regular security assessments can help mitigate these risks. Furthermore, updating API endpoints and ensuring they expose the minimum necessary information will contribute towards better data protection. Regularly monitoring network traffic for unusual activity can provide early detection of potential breaches, ensuring prompt action can be taken to protect the gridâ€™s stability and user data privacy.
