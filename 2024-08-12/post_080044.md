**What Happened:**
A joint threat bulletin was issued by the American Hospital Association (AHA) and Health-ISAC after a series of ransomware attacks by Russian cybercriminals affected blood suppliers and disrupted patient care in the US and UK. Notably, ransomware targeted Florida-based OneBlood, the pathology provider Synnovis, and blood plasma provider Octapharma, causing significant operational issues such as delayed shipments, surgery delays, and closed donation sites. These attacks compromised the availability of necessary medical supplies and patient health information.

**Why It Matters:**
The ransomware attacks highlight the critical vulnerability within the healthcare sector's third-party supply chains. Disruptions to essential services like blood supply and pathology can endanger patient lives and compromise the continuity of medical care. As these third-party suppliers are integral to healthcare operations, any cyber disruption can lead to widespread consequences, potentially affecting patient safety and operational integrity of healthcare facilities. Thus, these incidents underscore the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity measures and risk management strategies.

**Actions to be Taken:**
Healthcare providers should reassess their cybersecurity risk management frameworks and integrate third-party suppliers into their contingency planning. This includes identifying mission-critical suppliers and understanding potential vulnerabilities in the supply chain. Developing multidisciplinary third-party risk management governance committees can help manage and mitigate risks associated with external vendors. Additionally, healthcare organizations should evaluate their vendors' cybersecurity practices and consider whether alternative suppliers are available to ensure redundancy. Training and awareness programs should also be implemented to prepare staff for potential disruptions and to maintain operational resilience.
