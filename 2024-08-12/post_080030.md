### 1) What Happened

Microsoft has issued a reminder to customers that several editions of Windows 11, specifically 21H2 and 22H2, will reach their end-of-support date on October 8, 2024. This applies to various editions such as Home, Pro, Pro Education, Pro for Workstations, and SE. After this date, these editions will no longer receive monthly security updates and protections. To ensure continued security, Windows Update will automatically upgrade devices running these editions to the latest supported version.

### 2) Why It Matters

The end of support for these editions signifies that devices running Windows 11 21H2 and 22H2 will become vulnerable to security threats if not upgraded. Without regular security updates, these devices could be compromised, leading to potential data breaches and other cybersecurity incidents. For IT departments in large organizations, this underscores the importance of keeping systems updated to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with security protocols.

### 3) What Actions Should Be Taken

It is advisable to review the current versions of Windows running within the organization's infrastructure. Devices running Windows 11 21H2 and 22H2 should be scheduled for an upgrade to the latest supported version before October 8, 2024. IT departments should utilize tools like the PC Health Check app to ensure compatibility and address any potential upgrade issues. Additionally, awareness should be raised about the importance of these updates to ensure all stakeholders are informed and prepared for the transition.
