1) **What happened:** A Fortune 50 company paid a ransom of $75 million to the Dark Angels ransomware gang, breaking the previous record of $40 million set by CNA. The ransom payment was uncovered by Zscaler ThreatLabz and confirmed by Chainalysis. The attack, suspected to have occurred in early 2024, is speculated to have potentially impacted pharmaceutical giant Cencora, although this hasn't been officially confirmed. Dark Angels, known for targeting high-value companies using an approach called "Big Game Hunting," leverages stolen data and lateral network movements to demand substantial ransoms.

2) **Why it matters:** The payment of such a significant ransom highlights the growing threat and financial impact of ransomware on large corporations. This event signifies that ransomware groups are becoming more strategic and successful in their attacks, targeting richer victims for larger payouts. The record-breaking ransom also serves as a precedent that may encourage other cybercriminals to adopt similar tactics, potentially leading to more frequent and severe ransomware attacks. Such attacks can result in significant operational disruptions, data breaches, and financial losses.

3) **What actions should be taken:** Organizations are encouraged to enhance their cybersecurity measures by adopting advanced threat detection and mitigation strategies. This includes regular network scanning, employee training on phishing and social engineering attacks, and implementing robust backup systems that ensure business continuity without succumbing to ransom demands. Incident response plans should be reviewed and tested to handle ransomware incidents efficiently. Additionally, sharing threat intelligence in collaboration with other businesses and cybersecurity communities can help in understanding evolving tactics and preparing proactive defenses against similar attacks.
