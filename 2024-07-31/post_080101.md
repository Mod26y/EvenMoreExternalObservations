**1) What happened:**

Cybercriminals have incorporated Generative AI (GenAI) account credentials into their underground market offerings. These credentials, linked to prominent applications like ChatGPT, Quillbot, Notion, Huggingface, and Replit, are sold after being stolen via infostealer malware from corporate end users' computers. eSentireâ€™s research indicates that about 400 GenAI accounts are sold daily. One specific underground service, LLM Paradise, marketed these stolen credentials. Cybercriminals are using these credentials to monetize them in various ways, including phishing campaigns, malware deployment, chatbot creation, and theft of sensitive corporate data.

**2) Why it matters:**

The sale and misuse of GenAI credentials pose significant risks to organizations that rely on these platforms for their operations. Stolen credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive corporate information, identity theft, reputational damage, and financial loss. Additionally, the exploitation of GenAI accounts for phishing and malware attacks can have far-reaching consequences, enabling further data breaches and compromising the security of other users and systems. This growing trend underscores the escalating threats associated with cybercriminal activities targeting emerging technologies and highlights the importance of robust security practices and monitoring.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations might consider closely monitoring employee usage of cloud-based GenAI services to detect unusual activity. Implementing WebAuth and passkey security features can enhance account security, reducing the risk of credential theft. Encouraging adherence to strong password practices is essential. Utilizing Dark Web monitoring services can help organizations identify and respond to leaked credentials promptly. Additionally, educating employees about the potential risks and ensuring updated endpoint protection can further safeguard against infostealer malware that can compromise GenAI accounts.
