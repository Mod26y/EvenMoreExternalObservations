**What Happened:**  
On Microsoft's September 2025 Patch Tuesday, 81 security flaws were addressed, including two zero-day vulnerabilities. The zero-days affect the Windows SMB Server and Microsoft SQL Server. Alongside these, nine vulnerabilities were classified as "Critical," a number of them involving remote code execution. These updates brought solutions to issues like elevation of privilege and information disclosures. Auditing measures have been recommended for administrators to identify compatibility issues before enforcing certain security features.

**Why It Matters:**  
The announcement of fixes to two zero-day vulnerabilities is critical as these flaws were publicly disclosed and could have been exploited before patches were available. Zero-days pose significant risks as threat actors may have had opportunities to leverage them in attacks. The critical vulnerabilities addressed in this update, especially those involving remote code execution, highlight ongoing risk management challenges and the importance of keeping systems up to date to prevent unauthorized access and potential damages.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**  
Organizations should prioritize applying these patches to mitigate the identified security risks. Conducting compatibility audits on SMB servers is advised to prepare for potential issues when enabling protective features. Regular updating of monitoring tools to detect any misuse of known vulnerabilities should be emphasized. Besides applying patches, organizations should ensure their cybersecurity awareness training materials are up-to-date to include lessons learned from these vulnerabilities, emphasizing secure configuration practices and speedy response to new threats.
