1) What happened?

Microsoft released Windows 11 cumulative updates KB5065426 and KB5065431 as part of the September 2025 Patch Tuesday. These updates address security vulnerabilities and introduce various feature enhancements to Windows 11 versions 24H2 and 23H2. The updates include improvements in file explorer, privacy settings, widgets, authentication interfaces, and more. Microsoft also announced that support for Windows 11 version 23H2 will end on November 11, 2025. Devices on this version may need to upgrade to continue receiving updates.

2) Why it matters?

These updates are crucial as they address known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited if left unpatched. Organizations relying on Windows 11 systems need these patches to protect against potential threats and to ensure the system remains stable and secure. With the end of support for version 23H2 approaching, organizations must plan upgrades to avoid exposure to vulnerabilities that will no longer be addressed. Moreover, the functionalities introduced, like improved privacy controls and security settings, enhance user experience and system security.

3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?

County systems administrators should prioritize deploying these updates across all Windows 11 devices to mitigate potential security risks. They should also evaluate systems still using Windows 11 version 23H2 and plan upgrades to 24H2 before the end of the support deadline. To fully leverage new functionalities, administrators might conduct training or informational sessions on the update's features. Regular monitoring and review of update deployments to ensure all systems are current and any issues are quickly resolved will be beneficial for maintaining robust cybersecurity postures.
