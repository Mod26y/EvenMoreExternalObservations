In response, the company decided to cut executive pay as part of its broader strategy to address the fallout from the breach.

Such breaches can lead to severe financial losses, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational damage, affecting shareholder trust and customer loyalty.

3) What actions should be taken:
Organizations should conduct comprehensive assessments of their cybersecurity postures, ensuring that robust defenses and incident response plans are in place. It's important to foster a culture of accountability where executives are actively involved in cybersecurity strategies. Establishing regular security training, investing in advanced threat detection technologies, and engaging in simulations or drills can enhance preparedness. Furthermore, companies might consider revising compensation and incentive structures to align with cybersecurity objectives, ensuring that leaders are fully committed to safeguarding digital infrastructure.
