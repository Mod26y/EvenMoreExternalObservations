1. **What happened:**

Threat actors have exploited a loophole in Foundation accounting software used by general contractors, notably within the plumbing, HVAC, and concrete sub-industries. Discovered by Huntress researchers on Sept. 14, the attack involves misusing the Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) instance embedded in the software. Specifically, the TCP port 4243, used for mobile app access, is exposed publicly, enabling malicious users to execute commands with high privileges. Attackers have been brute-forcing access at scale and using default system admin credentials ("sa") to gain control over the server.

2. **Why it matters:**

This incident is significant as it demonstrates the vulnerabilities associated with essential industry-specific software, exposing critical operational and financial data to cyber threats. By leveraging the MSSQL server's high-privilege "sa" account, attackers can execute malicious commands and scripts that can lead to data theft, system compromise, and potential business disruptions. The construction industry's reliance on this software makes these attacks particularly damaging, highlighting the broader necessity of securing interconnected systems and applications against such threats.

3. **What actions should be taken:**

Organizations using Foundation software should consider rotating their credentials and choosing strong, unique passwords to mitigate the risk of brute-force attacks. Installation of the software should be configured to remain disconnected from the Internet unless absolutely necessary. Additionally, organizations should assess the exposure of the TCP port 4243 and, if required, reconfigure firewall settings to restrict access. Regular security audits and adherence to best practices for database and application security can further minimize vulnerability to such exploits.
