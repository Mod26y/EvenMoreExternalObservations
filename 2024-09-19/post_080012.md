### What Happened

Discord, a leading communication platform, introduced DAVE, a new end-to-end encryption (E2EE) protocol to protect audio and video calls from unauthorized interceptions. Created with input from cybersecurity experts at Trail of Bits, DAVE will cover one-on-one and group calls, server-based voice channels, and live streaming. This move affects the platform's vast user base, exceeding 200 million people, and aims to boost data security and privacy. The protocol's transparency is ensured by making it open-source and publishing a detailed whitepaper. The roll-out will initially cover desktop and mobile apps, with web clients to follow.

### Why It Matters

The integration of end-to-end encryption via the DAVE protocol is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it elevates the security and privacy of communications on Discord, which is increasingly used beyond its original gaming audience, including by businesses and various communities. This could make Discord a more attractive option for privacy-conscious users. Secondly, the open-source nature of DAVE and its accompanying whitepaper offer transparency, fostering trust and enabling external security audits. This initiative marks a pivotal step in improving the overall cybersecurity landscape of popular communication platforms, reflecting growing awareness and demand for robust data protection.

### Actions to Take

Given Discord's enhanced security, organizational users—such as businesses and community groups—should consider utilizing Discord for sensitive communication. Information security steering committees should monitor the roll-out to understand its full implications and evaluate its effectiveness. Additionally, technical staff should ensure that they are using the latest client applications to benefit from E2EE. It would also be prudent to review the DAVE protocol's whitepaper for a deeper understanding of the technical aspects and to stay informed about upcoming changes or potential vulnerabilities identified in this new system. Lastly, organizations should incorporate these advancements into their broader cybersecurity strategies.
