1) What happened: Microsoft is testing ad-supported versions of its Office desktop apps for Windows users. These versions allow users to edit documents with limited features and display a vertical ad panel in the application interface. Users are encouraged to subscribe to Microsoft 365 to remove the ads. Saving to local drives is restricted to those with a subscription, as documents edited in these apps can only be saved to OneDrive. This initiative seems to be a regional test as it could not be replicated globally per BleepingComputer’s investigation.

2) Why it matters: Introducing ad-supported versions of popular software like Microsoft Office changes the traditional software usage model and poses privacy and security concerns. Ads could potentially be a vector for malicious content if not properly vetted. This model also represents a shift towards monetization strategies catering to users who may not afford full-featured apps. It highlights the increasing overlap between software functionality and revenue generation, potentially influencing users' workflow by constraining where documents can be saved and creating dependency on cloud services.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should carefully assess the security implications of any ad-supported software to guard against the potential introduction of vulnerabilities. It’s crucial to review the impact of using cloud-only document saving to determine suitability for compliance. Evaluating alternative solutions or full-featured subscriptions may be beneficial for organizations reliant on rigorous data control. Keeping informed about Microsoft’s developments and conducting risk assessments regarding software changes will help maintain robust cybersecurity defenses. Moreover, organizations may consider educating users on the new app features and restrictions to ensure compliance and optimal use.
