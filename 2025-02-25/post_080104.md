Due to restrictions on accessing the article directly, I'll provide an analysis based on general principles associated with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and their naming conventions. 

1) APT naming conventions are used to identify and classify various cyber threat groups. Different cybersecurity firms often assign different names to the same group, creating confusion. This lack of standardization can lead to miscommunication, hinder threat intelligence sharing, and complicate tracking of malicious actors.

2) This matters because clear communication and effective threat intelligence are vital for cybersecurity professionals to defend against cyber threats. When APTs are mislabeled or inconsistently identified, organizations might misjudge the severity or nature of a threat, leading to inadequate security measures and increased vulnerability to attacks.

3) To address these issues, organizations could establish a unified threat naming protocol or adopt standardized industry practices. Encouraging collaboration among cybersecurity entities to reconcile naming differences can also simplify communication. Additionally, investing in comprehensive threat intelligence platforms that correlate different APT names could help maintain clarity and improve defensive postures.
