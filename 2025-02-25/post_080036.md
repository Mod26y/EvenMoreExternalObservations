1) **What happened:** A botnet comprising over 130,000 compromised devices is executing password-spray attacks on Microsoft 365 accounts globally. It exploits Basic Authentication, a legacy protocol, to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication protections and remain undetected. This technique uses non-interactive sign-ins, which do not trigger MFA in many situations. SecurityScorecard has linked these activities to the use of credentials stolen by infostealer malware. The attacks demonstrate a methodical attempt to exploit an outdated authentication method still active in some environments, facilitating unauthorized account access without triggering common security alerts.

2) **Why it matters:** The targeting of Basic Authentication in Microsoft 365 is significant because it reveals vulnerabilities in systems relying on outdated protocols. Basic Auth's transmission of credentials in plain form makes systems susceptible to attacks. Organizations not disabling Basic Auth or lacking proper monitoring for non-interactive logins are especially at risk. The large scale and international impact suggest that many organizations are potentially compromised, emphasizing the need for immediate review and update of authentication methods to protect sensitive information and maintain organizational security.

3) **Actions to be taken:** Organizations can enhance their security posture by immediately disabling Basic Authentication in Microsoft 365 environments. They should review and tighten Conditional Access Policies to restrict unauthorized login attempts. Deploying and mandating Multi-Factor Authentication across all accounts would provide an additional security layer. Monitoring for signs of such attacks in Entra ID logs is advised, focusing on anomalies such as failed login attempts from multiple IPs. Additionally, blocking the specific IP addresses mentioned in the attack report would help mitigate potential risks from this botnet.
