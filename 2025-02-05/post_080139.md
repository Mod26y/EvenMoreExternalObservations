**What Happened:**

Researchers identified a practice called "infrastructure laundering" linked to the China-based Funnull CDN, which exploits mainstream cloud hosting providers like AWS and Microsoft Azure. This technique involves renting IP addresses from these providers and linking them to criminal websites. Funnull has acquired over 1,200 IPs from AWS and almost 200 from Microsoft, continually obtaining new ones to evade detection. Despite efforts from providers to ban these IPs, the rapid acquisition and use cycle involves hosting numerous scam websites, complicating defense efforts due to the blending with legitimate web traffic.

**Why It Matters:**

This activity is significant because it demonstrates how threat actors can manipulate trusted cloud services to facilitate malicious endeavors like investment scams and fraudulent trading platforms. The use of well-regarded providers makes it difficult to block malicious traffic without affecting legitimate users. Additionally, the practice poses risks of money laundering and supply chain attacks, which could lead to data theft and business disruptions. The challenge lies in differentiating between malicious and legitimate activities as threat actors exploit shared infrastructure to achieve anonymity and enhance their reach.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**

Organizations should enhance their security postures by auditing cloud account activities and implementing robust monitoring to detect anomalous behavior. Utilizing multifactor authentication (MFA) can mitigate risks associated with stolen or cracked credentials. Educating staff to recognize signs of account misuse forms an integral part of a holistic security strategy. Collaborating with cloud providers to share information on abusive IPs and suspicious activities can support broader efforts to curtail such practices. Continuous review of security policies and proactive threat intelligence can further equip organizations to protect against evolving threats like infrastructure laundering.
