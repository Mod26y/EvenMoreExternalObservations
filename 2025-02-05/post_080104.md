In 2024, researchers discovered a significant rise in malware targeting user credentials, with 25% of analyzed malware focusing on this. This figure has tripled since 2023, elevating credential theft via password stores to a top-tier technique in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The findings from "The Red Report 2025" by Picus Security highlight the evolution of "SneakThief" malware, prioritizing stealth, persistence, and automation to enhance the effectiveness of multi-stage attacks. These attributes enable malware to perform numerous malicious actions while evading detection, posing heightened security challenges for organizations.

This matters because the shift towards credential theft indicates a growing trend among cybercriminals to prioritize high-reward targets, which can cause significant damage, such as unauthorized access to critical systems and data breaches. The increasing sophistication of malware challenges traditional security measures and demands enhanced defensive strategies. The widespread focus on such attacks requires organizations to reassess their security protocols, especially considering that an overwhelming majority of cyber activities involve exfiltration and stealth tactics, which could lead to severe operational and reputational damages.

Organizations should prioritize enhancing their defenses against credential theft by focusing on implementing and monitoring the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques, as suggested by researchers. This approach can disrupt cyberattack kill chains early, effectively mitigating 90% of malware threats. Security teams should invest in improving detection capabilities for complex, stealthy attacks and consider adopting advanced threat intelligence and automation tools to anticipate and respond to evolving threats like "SneakThief." Regularly updating security protocols and training employees on cybersecurity best practices will strengthen the organization's resilience against such sophisticated malware threats.
