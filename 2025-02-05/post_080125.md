Ransomware actors are leveraging a new tactic in their ransom notes by soliciting insider assistance to gain more information and cause further damage to targeted organizations, as detailed in a report by GroupSense. These groups, such as Sarcoma and an entity mimicking LockBit known as DoNex, are infusing pseudo-advertisements within ransom notes, urging employees to betray their employer for monetary rewards. The tactic aims to exploit disgruntled insiders by offering financial incentives to deepen system infiltration. This strategy reflects an evolution in how cybercriminals manipulate internal threats to expand their reach and maintain pressure on victims.

This development is significant because it marks a dangerous shift in ransomware methodologies, wherein the external threat perpetually lures internal collaborators to exacerbate impact and evade detection. By enticing employees to betray their organizations, these ransomware groups seek to create persistent vulnerabilities within company networks, intensifying challenges for cybersecurity defenses. Such tactics could potentially foster mistrust within organizations and strain internal relationships, making it harder to maintain effective security postures and respond to cyber incidents.

Organizations should recognize the increased risk posed by insider threats exacerbated by these tactics and emphasize robust insider threat programs. They are encouraged to fortify cybersecurity training, ensuring employees understand the risks and legality of engaging with threat actors. Proper whistleblowing mechanisms and incentivizing internal reporting without fear of reprisal can counteract the lure of these criminal offers. Additionally, cybersecurity teams should monitor communications for potential insider collaborations and enhance overall network security to mitigate unauthorized access attempts inspired by such provocative ransom notes.
