1) Zyxel has announced that it will not be patching recently exploited vulnerabilities in its end-of-life (EoL) routers, specifically impacting the CPE Series devices. The key vulnerabilities, identified as CVE-2024-40891 and CVE-2025-0890, include a Telnet command injection flaw and weak default credentials, both which allow unauthorized access and arbitrary code execution. Though EoL, over 1,500 such devices remain exposed online, highlighting a significant attack surface.

2) This issue matters because it underscores ongoing security risks tied to legacy hardware that remains in service. The inability or refusal to patch these routers leaves systems vulnerable, presenting a tempting target for attackers who exploit these weaknesses to gain network entry. It reflects broader challenges in IoT and network security where outdated, unsupported devices remain operational, posing persistent and exploitable vulnerabilities that can lead to data breaches or network disruptions.

3) As a response, organizations using Zyxel's EoL routers should assess their network for these vulnerable devices and plan for their replacement with supported models offering regular security updates. Additionally, users need to prioritize changing default credentials on all network equipment and maintain an inventory of all connected devices to better manage and secure them. Consideration of network segmentation and monitoring for anomalous activities can also mitigate risks associated with older equipment that might still be operational in the network.
