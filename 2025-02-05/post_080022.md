The "SparkCat" campaign involves malicious SDKs in Android and iOS apps found on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, designed to steal crypto wallet recovery phrases using optical character recognition (OCR) stealer technology. The infected apps, unknowingly bundled by developers, were downloaded over 242,000 times from Google Play, with this type of malware being discovered on the App Store for the first time. The malware targets recovery phrases by extracting text from images, enabling attackers to access cryptocurrency wallets. The campaign highlights the potential vulnerability in mobile app ecosystems affecting user financial security.

This event underscores the growing threat landscape posed by mobile app vulnerabilities, especially concerning financial assets like cryptocurrency. Given that both Android and iOS platforms were compromised, the situation affects a broad user base, enhancing risks of unauthorized access to significant personal and financial data. Such incidents erode consumer trust in app store security and emphasize the need for rigorous due diligence in mobile app vetting processes. Furthermore, it highlights the necessity for users to adopt safe practices for storing sensitive information like cryptocurrency recovery phrases.

In light of this information, users should immediately uninstall any apps listed in the Kaspersky report and run a comprehensive scan with reliable mobile antivirus tools. It is advisable to perform a factory reset on affected devices as a precautionary measure. Users should review the storage of cryptocurrency recovery phrases and transition to secure methods, such as offline physical media or encrypted storage, rather than digital screenshots. Moreover, app developers should scrutinize third-party SDKs included in their applications for malicious components, enhancing overall security practices. Regular updates from app stores on malicious incidents can help users stay informed about emerging threats.
