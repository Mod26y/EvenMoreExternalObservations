1) Microsoft plans to retire the "Send to Kindle" feature in Word, which previously enabled users to transmit Word documents directly to their Kindle libraries. This feature will be phased out after February 2026, though an exact cessation date is not specified. Once retired, users must manually send documents through the Send to Kindle website. The current functionality allowed for documents to retain their formatting styles when transferred, providing utility for users needing Kindle-compatible formats.

2) The removal of this feature affects users who rely on seamless integration between Microsoft Word and Kindle for document portability and presentation. It highlights an ongoing trend of feature discontinuation and migration to web-based services, urging users to adapt their workflows. For organizations, particularly in publishing or education, this may necessitate procedural adjustments to accommodate changes in document distribution to Kindle platforms.

3) Organizations should assess which staff or departments rely on the "Send to Kindle" feature and prepare by training them on alternative methods outlined by Microsoft, such as using the Send to Kindle website. It’s advisable to communicate the scheduled changes early and establish a timeline for transition. Additionally, IT teams can evaluate other document sharing and conversion tools that may better integrate with existing workflows, ensuring minimal disruption to productivity when the feature is retired.
