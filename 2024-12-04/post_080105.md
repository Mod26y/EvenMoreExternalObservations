The report indicates that phishing remains a key tool for cyberattacks, exploiting human emotions to deceive users. It also notes the growing use of QR codes in phishing campaigns, which presents new challenges due to its versatility and perceived legitimacy.

This highlights the urgent need for organizations to prioritize human risk management and enhance their security culture, as employee awareness and training become indispensable in preemptively combating these attacks.

**3) What actions should be taken:** Organizations are encouraged to bolster their security protocols by focusing on employee education and awareness regarding phishing tactics. Regular training programs can help users recognize and handle phishing attempts effectively, including emerging methods such as QR code phishing. Implementing AI-driven phishing detection systems and integrating robust email security solutions can further shield against malicious activity. Encouraging a security-focused culture that emphasizes vigilance and verification before action can significantly mitigate the risk of successful phishing attacks, transforming employees from potential liability to the first line of defense.
