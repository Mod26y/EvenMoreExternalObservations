This article highlights a significant cybersecurity issue involving the misconfiguration of Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), particularly when used with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). Research by Zafran identifies that nearly 40% of Fortune 100 companies using CDN-provided WAF services have left their back-end servers vulnerable to direct internet attacks due to incorrect configuration. This vulnerability affects major organizations, making their servers susceptible to denial-of-service attacks, ransomware distribution, and other malicious activities. The core issue lies in the inadequate validation of web requests to back-end servers, leaving protected applications open to unintended internet traffic.

This misconfiguration issue matters because it has exposed critical infrastructure of many high-profile organizations to potential cyberattacks. The risk is heightened by the ability of attackers to easily find IP addresses of origin servers through tools like certificate transparency logs. Such vulnerabilities are akin to leaving sensitive resources unnecessarily exposed, undermining the effectiveness of security measures. The pervasiveness of this problem highlights a widespread failure to follow best security practices, posing significant risks to business operations, sensitive data, and reputational integrity if exploited.

Organizations using CDN-based WAF services should revisit and revise their server configurations to ensure robust security measures are in place. Key actions include implementing best practices such as adding IP filtering mechanisms, employing pre-shared digital secrets, and using mutual TLS authentication to limit access to back-end servers. Regularly auditing server configurations and undertaking checks on publicly accessible security logs to discover vulnerabilities early can also help. Collaboration with CDN providers for guidance on securing their services effectively is essential to mitigate these risks comprehensively.
