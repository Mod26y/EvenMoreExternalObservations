Malicious browser extensions are bypassing Google's new security measures for Chrome extensions, putting user data at risk. Researchers from SquareX showcased security gaps in Googleâ€™s Manifest V3 update, revealing how extensions could steal video feeds, data, and redirect users to phishing sites. Despite Google's intent to improve privacy and security controls in Chrome extensions, the current model still allows malicious actors too much leeway due to broad permissions. Such vulnerabilities pose considerable threats as extensions infiltrate both individual and organizational systems, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

This issue is important because Chrome is a widely used browser across various industries, including enterprise environments. The ability for malicious extensions to navigate past security protocols endangers not only personal information but also sensitive corporate data, potentially leading to data breaches and financial losses. As Manifest V3 permissions allow considerable access to web content, the ineffective screening raises concerns about data security across the organization. Ensuring robust security protocols for browser extensions is essential given their ability to operate like internal applications, thus extending the risk considerably.

Organizations should conduct thorough audits of current Chrome extensions and evaluate necessary permission levels, removing those that appear suspicious or overreaching. Improving oversight and implementing tools to track extension activity can identify potential threats early. Google's extension surveillance tools and resources, such as CRXcavator, should be employed to assess extension risk levels continuously. Furthermore, enhancing employee awareness about risks posed by browser extensions could mitigate potential threats. Collaboration between companies like Google and cybersecurity experts is also crucial for tighter permission models that reduce exposure to such vulnerabilities.
