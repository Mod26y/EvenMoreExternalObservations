GorillaBot, a new variant of the Mirai malware, has significantly increased cyberattack activity globally, executing over 300,000 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and impacting approximately 20,000 organizations. The attacks utilize multiple DDoS methods, predominantly UDP packet floods and TCP ACK bypass floods, making it challenging for targeted organizations to defend against them. The botnet uses Mirai source code but includes distinct modifications and employs multiple command-and-control servers to orchestrate its actions. The global nature of the attacks, along with their frequency, underscores the persistent and evolving threat posed by botnets in today's digital landscape.

The impact of GorillaBot is critical as it highlights the growing sophistication and scale of botnet-driven DDoS attacks, which can cause significant operational disruptions to affected organizations. Its multivector attack approach necessitates nuanced and comprehensive defense strategies, making it difficult for businesses to rely on single defensive measures. The prevalence of "bad bots," which constitute a substantial portion of internet traffic, indicates an increasing need for robust cybersecurity measures and awareness, especially in sectors prone to DDoS activities like gaming, telecommunications, and healthcare.

Organizations should enhance their defensive strategies against DDoS attacks through a combination of technologies and techniques. Implementing rate limiting and utilizing stateful firewalls will help counter UDP floods and SYN/ACK flood attacks. Deploying intrusion detection and prevention systems can also bolster the ability to detect and block attack traffic. Regularly updating the organization's security posture in response to the latest threats, along with testing response strategies against such attacks, is essential. Additionally, fostering partnerships with cybersecurity vendors for advanced DDoS protection and continuing cybersecurity awareness training can further mitigate risks.
