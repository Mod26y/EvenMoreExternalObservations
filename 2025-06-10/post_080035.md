Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-patched-bug-leaking-phone-numbers-tied-to-accounts/

1) **What Happened**: A security researcher identified a vulnerability within Google's legacy username recovery form that allowed for the brute-forcing of phone numbers associated with Google accounts. By cleverly bypassing the form's rate-limiting and CAPTCHAs, attackers could connect a user's partial and full phone numbers to their profile, posing risks of SIM-swapping and phishing. Google fixed the vulnerability by fully deprecating the form after initially downplaying its severity.

2) **Why It Matters**: This vulnerability highlights significant risks tied to leaked personal data, particularly phone numbers, which can lead to targeted cyberattacks. Phone number exposure can facilitate widespread phishing or SIM swap attacks, jeopardizing personal privacy and security. Such leaks undermine trust in digital platforms intended to protect usersâ€™ sensitive information, emphasizing the continuous need for rigorous security checks on legacy systems and forms.

3) **Actions to be Taken**: Organizations should review and update legacy systems to ensure they are not vulnerable to similar exploits. Enhanced automated monitoring for unusual access patterns or rate-limit bypass attempts would also be beneficial. Users are encouraged to regularly update recovery information and use two-factor authentication. Awareness campaigns can educate users on the dangers of SIM-swapping and phishing to mitigate risks. Regular vulnerability assessments and proactive fixes by the tech companies can prevent such issues from being exploited.
