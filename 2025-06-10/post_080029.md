The Roundcube webmail software has a critical vulnerability, CVE-2025-49113, impacting versions 1.1.0 to 1.6.10. This flaw enables remote code execution through unsanitized input, allowing PHP object deserialization and session corruption. While the flaw was patched on June 1, 2025, attackers quickly developed an exploit, which is circulating in underground forums. The vulnerability requires authentication, but attackers can gain credentials via methods like CSRF and brute force, posing a risk given Roundcubeâ€™s extensive use in various sectors worldwide.

This vulnerability matters because over 84,000 Roundcube instances, including many in essential sectors like government, education, and technology, remain at risk. With hackers developing and selling exploits, credentials can be compromised, leading to severe consequences including data breaches and unauthorized access. The potential for widespread exploitation threatens sensitive information on a large scale, reflecting the urgent need for faster security measures.

Organizations using Roundcube should upgrade to versions 1.6.11 or 1.5.10, which contain patches for the flaw, to reduce risk. Those unable to update should restrict webmail access, disable file uploads, enhance CSRF protections, block potentially harmful PHP functions, and actively monitor for signs of exploitation. Robust security practices and system monitoring can help mitigate potential intrusion and data loss while protecting user credentials.
