1) What happened: Unfortunately, due to the 403 Client Error, the specific article content is inaccessible. However, it can be inferred from the title that a cyberattack group known as "Librarian Ghouls" strikes at night to exploit certain vulnerabilities. Typically, night-time attacks leverage reduced monitoring by staff, aiming to deploy ransomware, exfiltrate data, or disrupt systems.

2) Why it matters: Night-time attacks pose significant risks as they exploit less vigilant periods within organizations, potentially resulting in severe data breaches or operational disruptions. Such attacks by groups like "Librarian Ghouls" highlight the need for robust, around-the-clock cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information and maintain operational integrity.

3) What actions should be taken: Implementing enhanced night-time monitoring and automated alert systems can fortify defenses against attacks similar to those perpetrated by the "Librarian Ghouls." Regularly updating security protocols, conducting threat assessments, and maintaining comprehensive incident response plans are also beneficial. Employee training programs should emphasize vigilance during off-peak hours to ensure rapid detection and mitigation of any potential cyber threats.
