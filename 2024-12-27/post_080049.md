A new Mirai-based botnet is exploiting a vulnerability in DigiEver DS-2105 Pro NVRs, TP-Link routers, and Teltonika RUT9XX routers. The campaign began in October, taking advantage of unpatched or outdated devices. The botnet utilizes remote code execution for command injection, enabling attackers to enlist devices into the botnet. It employs XOR and ChaCha20 encryption, which indicates evolved tactics. This activity is notable as it targets multiple system architectures, suggesting a widespread potential impact.

This threat is significant because it highlights the vulnerabilities present in widely-used network devices such as NVRs and routers. Compromised devices can be utilized in DDoS attacks or for broader malicious operations, increasing the risk to both businesses and individuals. The involvement of inadequately patched devices emphasizes the importance of regular updates and vulnerability management. The botnet's use of advanced encryption techniques signifies a shift towards more sophisticated cyber threat tactics and highlights the ongoing evolution of malware strategies.

Organizations are advised to inventory and assess all network devices to ensure firmware is updated to the latest versions, mitigating vulnerabilities like CVE-2023-1389 and CVE-2018-17532. Employing intrusion detection systems that utilize the provided indicators of compromise (IoC) can aid in identifying and blocking potential threats. Additionally, implementing stringent network segmentation and firewall configurations helps prevent unauthorized access. Cybersecurity teams should stay informed about evolving threats and improve security measures as necessary to protect critical infrastructure and assets.
