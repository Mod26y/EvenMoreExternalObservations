The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced new cybersecurity disclosure rules, significantly increasing incident reports from public companies by 60% since 2023. However, the reports frequently lack detailed explanations of the material impacts of those incidents. Most companies struggle to balance transparent reporting while protecting sensitive internal information. The rules aim to ensure investors are aware of incidents that could influence investment decisions, but clarity regarding materiality is limited, leaving vital questions unanswered. Third-party breaches also complicate the disclosure process, as companies decide whether to disclose incidents already reported by their partners or vendors.

The increase in incident reports without detailed impact assessments matters because incomplete information can mislead investors and stakeholders about a company's cybersecurity posture and operational risks. This lack of detail can potentially affect company valuation, investor confidence, and compliance with regulations, leading to reputational and financial consequences. Companies need to effectively determine material impacts to provide accurate disclosures, account for third-party risks, and manage their cybersecurity strategies more comprehensively. This development also emphasizes the need for companies to refine their criteria for assessing the materiality of incidents.

Companies would benefit from enhancing their incident disclosure processes, including conducting more thorough materiality assessments before reporting and improving coordination between cybersecurity teams and corporate governance. Organizations should consider adopting tabletop exercises to simulate response scenarios, which can aid in refining decision-making for timely and detailed disclosures. Engaging legal and financial advisors in this process ensures alignment with regulatory expectations and helps communicate incidents' financial and operational impacts clearly. Additionally, businesses should establish robust third-party risk management strategies to better evaluate and disclose vendor-related breaches effectively.
