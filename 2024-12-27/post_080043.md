1) The article discusses several lesser-known features of Windows 11's Task Manager that improve its functionality. It highlights tools like generating live kernel dumps for debugging, pausing the Task Manager to make process selection easier, utilizing "Efficiency Mode" to manage CPU usage, examining and managing startup apps to optimize boot times, and App History to track resource usage by applications. These features are designed to assist users in managing system performance, diagnosing issues, and efficiently utilizing system resources.

2) Understanding and utilizing these Task Manager features is important for IT professionals within organizations to efficiently diagnose and address system performance issues. As endpoints run applications constantly, optimizations can lead to significant resource savings, lower power consumption, and enhance overall security. The live kernel dump feature aids in advanced diagnostics, important when troubleshooting complex system errors or security incidents. Recognizing unusual startup items can aid in identifying potential malware, thereby reducing the risk of cyber threats.

3) Organizations should consider training their IT staff and system users to effectively use these Task Manager features to optimize device performance and maintain security. Implement a process where live kernel dumps can be analyzed when unexplained crashes occur. IT departments should routinely audit Startup Apps to disable unnecessary programs and identify potential malware using tools like VirusTotal. Encourage the exploration of App History to monitor excessive resource utilization which could point to inefficiencies or security incidents. Efficient use of these features can enhance both productivity and system security.
