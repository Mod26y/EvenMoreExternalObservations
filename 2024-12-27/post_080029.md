Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-installation-media-bug-causes-security-update-failures/

1) What happened: Microsoft has identified a bug in the installation process of Windows 11 version 24H2 when using physical media like CDs or USB drives that includes security updates from October and November 2024. This bug prevents future Windows security updates from being accepted by the system. Notably, this issue is not present when updates are performed via Windows Update or the Microsoft Update Catalog. Microsoft is addressing the problem and advises using the December 2024 security update to avoid these complications during installation.

2) Why it matters: This issue is significant because it affects the security posture of systems using these installation methods. Without the ability to receive subsequent security updates, these systems remain vulnerable to known and emerging threats, undermining the integrity of organizational networks. This situation is especially critical for managed IT environments, where maintaining up-to-date security patches is pivotal in defending against cybersecurity incidents and ensuring compliance with security policies.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should avoid using installation media containing October and November 2024 updates and instead use the December 2024 security update for media installations of Windows 11 24H2. IT departments might consider auditing current systems to ensure no affected installations exist. They should also stay updated with Microsoft's developments on this issue and adjust installation practices as needed to maintain secure and compliant IT environments. Enhanced communication with end-users can help ensure promptly addressing potential update interruptions.
