The article discusses the outdated "trust but verify" cybersecurity strategy, which assumes that once a user or device is initially verified, it remains trustworthy indefinitely. Critically, this approach leaves organizations vulnerable because it does not account for insider threats or account for changes over time. A lack of ongoing verification has led many businesses to be more susceptible to breaches, particularly when trusted entities act maliciously or fail to maintain compliance with evolving security measures.

This outdated strategy matters because it significantly heightens security risks and financial impacts. Businesses face mounting costs from breaches, including fines, lawsuits, lost customer trust, and brand damage. Additionally, regulatory bodies increasingly demand continuous monitoring of identity and access management, with significant penalties for non-compliance. The reality outlined in the article underscores the necessary transition to more robust security postures to avoid potentially catastrophic and career-damaging incidents.

Organizations are encouraged to adopt a zero-trust strategy, which emphasizes "never trust, always verify." Zero-trust limits potential damage by ensuring continuous scrutiny and validation of all users, devices, and applications trying to access a network. Shifting to zero-trust reduces both the attack surface and required maintenance, while also aligning with stricter regulatory requirements. As organizations implement this approach, they should build testing into their strategy to ensure their security measures are effective and resilient against evolving threats.
