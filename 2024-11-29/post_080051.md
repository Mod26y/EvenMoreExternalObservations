1) What happened:
Operation Undercut is a newly exposed malign influence campaign orchestrated by the Russian group Social Design Agency (SDA), uncovered by researchers from Recorded Future's Insikt Group. Running simultaneously with another campaign named Doppelgänger, Operation Undercut seeks to weaken support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia while also meddling in Middle Eastern affairs, EU politics, and the lead-up to the 2024 US presidential election. Utilizing AI-enhanced videos, the SDA creates deceptive content shown on platforms like social media, purporting to be from legitimate news sources, thus spreading misinformation and sowing discord among Western audiences.

2) Why it matters:
This campaign matters because it demonstrates a strategic effort by the SDA to influence public opinion and policy in pivotal geopolitical matters, aiming to destabilize alliances and weaken Western support for Ukraine. Operation Undercut's use of AI and impersonation tactics poses a direct threat to information integrity, mirroring broader objectives seen in previous cyber influence operations. The misinformation can mislead citizens and policymakers, potentially impacting foreign aid decisions, election outcomes, and overall trust in media. Moreover, limited engagement doesn’t equate to limited impact as misinformation can ripple through societies, influencing perceptions and actions over time.

3) What actions should be taken:
Immediate actions should involve enhancing monitoring and tracking of disinformation campaigns, especially those targeting elections and geopolitical events. Collaboration between government entities, social media platforms, and cybersecurity organizations is essential to identify and mitigate the spread of such content swiftly. Educational programs targeted at increasing public awareness about recognizing and responding to misinformation can help build societal resilience against these tactics. Additionally, rigorous examination of source authenticity in media consumption can be encouraged. Legal actions similar to the DOJ’s domain seizures should continue to be pursued, alongside further research to adapt defensive strategies to evolving tactics and technologies used by such campaigns.
