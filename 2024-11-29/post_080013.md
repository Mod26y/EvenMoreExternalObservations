**1) What happened:**

The Tor Project has initiated a campaign to recruit volunteers to deploy 200 new WebTunnel bridges to counter increasing government censorship, notably in Russia. This censorship undermines Tor’s existing circumvention mechanisms, making access to uncensored internet more difficult for users in heavily restricted regions. These WebTunnel bridges, which disguise Tor traffic as regular HTTPS traffic, help bypass these blocks. The project's goal is to have these bridges operational by March 2025, ensuring continued access to the open internet for users facing aggressive censorship measures.

**2) Why it matters:**

This situation highlights the escalating digital authoritarianism during which governments implement censorship to restrict citizens’ internet access, stifling freedom of information and expression. The effectiveness of Tor as a tool for privacy and open internet access underscores the importance of technological solutions in battling censorship. The call for new WebTunnel bridges is critical, as without them, users in censored regions risk being isolated from global digital communication, which can have broader implications for civil liberties and human rights in these regions.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

Organizations and individuals interested in supporting free internet access should consider participating in the Tor Project’s campaign to set up WebTunnel bridges. This involves offering technical assistance, such as providing static IPv4 addresses and bandwidth resources, to enhance the network’s robustness. Educational initiatives about digital privacy tools could also be promoted within targeted regions to heighten awareness and adoption. Collaborating with global tech communities can further help innovate and deploy new tools to continually adapt to evolving censorship strategies, thus ensuring ongoing support for free information exchange.
