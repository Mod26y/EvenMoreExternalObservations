1) What happened: Microsoft re-released its November 2024 security updates for Exchange Server after encountering mail delivery issues on servers employing custom mail flow or data loss prevention (DLP) rules. The initial updates caused email flow disruptions, prompting Microsoft to temporarily withdraw them. Admins were later advised to implement the revised updates (Nov 2024 SUv2) to rectify mail delivery issues. The new version also offers enhanced control over certain mail headers to combat potential exploits of a significant Exchange Server vulnerability.

2) Why it matters: The re-release is pivotal as it ensures reliable email communication for organizations relying on Exchange Server. Custom mail flow disruptions can lead to significant operational setbacks, especially for critical sectors relying heavily on consistent communication. Additionally, the new update enhances security by offering better detection and warnings against a serious Exchange vulnerability, helping prevent potential attacks that exploit forged sender identities. Ensuring up-to-date security measures is crucial for maintaining the trustworthiness and functionality of email systems.

3) What actions should be taken: Administrators should promptly install the revised Nov 2024 SUv2 update if they encountered issues with the initial version or have not yet updated their systems. Running the Exchange Health Checker script post-installation is advised to identify and address any configuration anomalies. Those with automatic updates enabled via Windows Update will receive the new patch in December. The security enhancements of SUv2 emphasize the need to toggle on secure-by-default settings to mitigate risks associated with malicious emails. Planning updates outside critical periods like holidays can also prevent disruptions.
