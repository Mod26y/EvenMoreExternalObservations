1) Based on available context, "#OpIndia" is a hacktivist campaign that emerged following an attack in Pahalgam. Hacktivists, who often engage in cyber activities to promote political agendas, have united under this operation potentially to protest or draw attention to issues related to the attack or its broader implications. These kinds of movements can involve distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, data leaks, or defacement campaigns targeting government or corporate entities associated with the perceived cause of grievance.

2) This event matters because coordinated hacktivist campaigns can disrupt critical infrastructure, causing operational and reputational damage. Such actions may target public services, thereby affecting citizens and undermining trust in government or corporate entities. Additionally, these operations can escalate geopolitical tensions, especially when national or cultural symbols are involved. Understanding the motivations and methods of hacktivists is crucial to anticipating potential cyber threats and implementing effective risk management strategies.

3) In light of this information, entities potentially affected should enhance their cybersecurity postures by conducting threat intelligence monitoring to detect early signs of hacktivist activities. Implementing advanced threat detection systems and conducting regular security audits can be beneficial. Organizations might also consider adopting robust incident response plans and increasing public awareness and communication efforts to mitigate the impact of any such attacks. Engaging with law enforcement and peer organizations to share intelligence and best practices could further bolster defense mechanisms against such threats.
