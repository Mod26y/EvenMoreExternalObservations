**What happened:** ChatGPT's Deep Research functionality is introducing a "Download as PDF" option. This feature allows users to save AI-generated comprehensive research reports while maintaining the original formatting—something the current 'copy' function struggles with. This development is in its testing phase, as noticed on social media platform X, and accompanies a new GitHub connector for Teams subscribers. The timeline for full rollout and applicability to regular queries remains unspecified.

**Why it matters:** Enhancing ChatGPT’s functionality to download outputs as PDF improves user experience by preserving document formatting, critical for professionals who rely on structured data presentation. It increases ChatGPT's attractiveness for in-depth tasks and potentially broadens its applicability across various sectors, including academia and business. Additionally, by facilitating integration with GitHub, OpenAI aims to attract more organizations and development teams, which may lead to broader adoption and feedback for further innovation.

**What actions should be taken:** Information security committees should monitor the rollout of this feature to evaluate any security and compliance implications, particularly related to data privacy and the integrity of downloadable content. Organizations might consider training sessions to educate staff on leveraging this new functionality efficiently while ensuring data handling policies are updated to reflect changes in data export capabilities. Additionally, IT departments could begin assessing potential benefits of integrating ChatGPT’s new features with existing systems or processes.
