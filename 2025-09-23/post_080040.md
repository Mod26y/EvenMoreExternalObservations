1) The new EDR-Freeze tool exploits a design weakness in Windows Error Reporting (WER) to suspend security software like EDR and antivirus processes. By using the WerFaultSecure component with the MiniDumpWriteDump API, the tool can indefinitely suspend these processes without needing kernel driver vulnerabilities. This approach is stealthy, operating entirely in user mode and leveraging default Windows components, thus bypassing traditional EDR disabling methods that require vulnerable drivers.

2) This development is significant as it demonstrates a new method for attackers to bypass security measures by exploiting a design flaw rather than a software vulnerability. The use of legitimate Windows components increases the difficulty of detection and mitigation, posing a substantial risk to systems relying on EDR tools for protection. Since the method works without requiring risky driver exploits, it could be more accessible to attackers, potentially leading to an increase in successful intrusions.

3) To counteract the EDR-Freeze method, organizations may need to bolster monitoring tactics to identify suspicious WER activity, especially if it targets critical processes like security tools or LSASS. Security teams should consider employing tools to map and track WER mappings to security processes and flag anomalies. Furthermore, engagement with Microsoft and other security vendors for possible patches or enhancements to harden WER and related components could be beneficial. Regularly updating security protocols and educating staff about the latest threats can also help in mitigating such risks.
