1) The American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB) experienced a vulnerability on its website that allowed users to download protected and private media using a simple script. This flaw, known as an insecure direct object reference (IDOR), let users change media IDs to access unauthorized content. The vulnerability was publicized through online communities and was reportedly exploited since 2021. It has since been patched following a tip-off from a cybersecurity researcher who had informed AAPB earlier.

2) The vulnerability's significance lies in the exposure of potentially sensitive and restricted media, which undermines the privacy and security intended by archival organizations like AAPB. While not specifically exploited maliciously, the breach highlights how archival data can be improperly accessed and distributed among online communities, often blurring into digital piracy territory. Such vulnerabilities can harm the organization's reputation and trust, cementing the need for improved security protocols to protect digital archives.

3) Following this incident, AAPB and similar organizations could consider regularly auditing their security systems to detect and fix vulnerabilities proactively. Establishing a responsible disclosure policy with ethical hackers can help identify flaws before they are exploited. Strengthening access controls and monitoring for unusual access patterns would augment defenses against future breaches. Additionally, conducting regular staff training on cybersecurity and fostering a culture of security awareness can build resilience against such exploits.
