**What happened:**
The article marks the 15th anniversary of the Zero Trust security model, emphasizing its increasing relevance in combating cyber threats. Over the years, the Zero Trust framework, which mandates verifying every entity before granting access, has become pivotal as perimeter-based security models fail to address sophisticated cybersecurity challenges. This shift in security philosophy underscores a growing recognition in the industry that ensuring each user's and system's validity continuously is crucial amidst evolving threat landscapes.

**Why it matters:**
Zero Trust's significance has grown due to the expanding and increasingly complex nature of cyber threats. As organizations face breaches and data theft, traditional security approaches prove inadequate. Zero Trust addresses these vulnerabilities by implementing stringent access controls and continuous verification, even for internal traffic. For large entities, such as a US County, adopting this model is crucial to safeguarding sensitive data, ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining public trust in the integrity of its digital infrastructure and citizen services.

**What actions should be taken:**
The information security steering committee should consider evaluating the current security architecture's alignment with Zero Trust principles. They can initiate a transition towards a Zero Trust model by conducting an inventory of all assets, users, and data flows. Implementing identity and access management solutions, along with real-time monitoring of network activities, is advisable. Awareness and training programs should be developed to foster a familiarization with Zero Trust concepts, ensuring all stakeholders understand the importance of least-privilege access and verification. By taking these steps, the County will enhance its resilience against emerging cybersecurity threats.
