Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-removes-windows-11-safeguard-hold-after-fixing-face-detection-bug/

**What happened:**

Microsoft has removed a compatibility hold that previously prevented devices with integrated cameras from upgrading to Windows 11 version 24H2. The block was due to a face detection bug, which caused app freezes when using the Camera app, Windows Hello, and other camera-dependent applications. Initially identified in October 2024, the issue has now been resolved, allowing affected devices to proceed with the update. Microsoft noted that it might take up to 48 hours for the update to be available to eligible devices, with a device restart potentially expediting the process.

**Why it matters:**

This development is significant for users and IT administrators relying on integrated cameras for security and productivity tasks, such as biometric authentication and video conferencing. The face detection bug potentially impacted user trust and security, hindering effective use of these features. Lifting the update block not only provides users access to new enhancements and security patches but also reduces vulnerability risks associated with outdated software. This action underscores the importance of addressing compatibility and security issues promptly to ensure smooth and secure user experiences.

**What actions should be taken:**

Organizations and users should prioritize installing the latest Windows 11 update once available to benefit from its improvements and security fixes. It's advisable to restart devices to potentially expedite the update process and ensure other security patches are applied. IT departments should communicate the update's availability and importance to end-users, especially those using affected features. Continuous monitoring of Microsoft's updates and advisories is essential to stay informed on any new or lingering issues that may affect system stability or security.
