The article highlights the issue of underfunding in small US government cybersecurity agencies, particularly impacting the National Vulnerabilities Database (NVD) managed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In February 2024, due to lack of resources, NIST halted the enrichment of vulnerability data, causing significant disruption in cybersecurity efforts globally. This interruption demonstrated the dependency on underfunded bodies for crucial cybersecurity functions, which in turn increased global cyber risk during the gap.

This matter underscores the critical dependency of global cybersecurity on a well-resourced NVD, an essential tool for vulnerability management. Robust cybersecurity infrastructure is foundational to safeguarding national security, economic prosperity, and public health. Inadequate funding of such agencies not only weakens the overall cybersecurity posture but also risks the government's ability to manage cyber-threats effectively, potentially undermining the US's leadership in global cybersecurity.

Actions to address this concern include advocating for proper budget allocations to essential cybersecurity agencies like NIST to ensure they are equipped to fulfill their roles. Additionally, exploring alternative operational models, such as public-private partnerships, could enhance resource efficiency and resilience. Congress should prioritize passing annual appropriations bills over continuing resolutions, enabling agencies to plan and adapt to evolving cyber threats effectively. Stakeholders can rally support to promote awareness and influence funding decisions, ensuring cybersecurity functions are adequately resourced.
