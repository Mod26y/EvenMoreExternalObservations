The article details a high-severity logic flaw in the abandoned async-tar Rust library and its popular fork, tokio-tar, known as the TARmageddon vulnerability, listed as CVE-2025-62518. This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to perform remote code execution by injecting additional archive entries during TAR file extraction. Specifically, the desynchronization issue arises when processing mismatched headers in nested TAR files, potentially allowing attackers to overwrite files in supply chain attacks. Although some forks of the library have been patched, others, like the widely used tokio-tar, remain unpatched.

This vulnerability is significant because it affects a large ecosystem due to the popularity of the tokio-tar library, with over 7 million downloads. Many projects, including critical infrastructure like Binstalk and wasmCloud, are at risk. The potential for attackers to exploit this flaw to directly manipulate files increases the risk of supply chain attacks, compromising software integrity and distributing malicious code broadly. Moreover, the issue spotlights the risks associated with abandoned software libraries, emphasizing the potential widespread impact.

To mitigate risks, organizations using the vulnerable libraries should transition to patched versions or remove the affected dependencies. Specifically, developers are advised to upgrade to the actively maintained astral-tokio-tar fork if their projects rely on tokio-tar. Immediate assessment of project dependencies for the vulnerable libraries should be carried out. Additionally, community awareness should be raised to identify potentially impacted projects and alert developers who may still rely on abandoned libraries for swift corrective actions.
