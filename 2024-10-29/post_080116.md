The article outlines China's strategic advancement in cybersecurity through the establishment and proliferation of Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions. Over the past decade, these contests have become instrumental in training a vast number of cybersecurity specialists and strengthening connections between academia, government, and industry. China's Ministry of Education and other governmental bodies sponsor numerous cybersecurity events, fostering an ecosystem where practical skills and real-world application are emphasized. The shift towards a robust cybersecurity pipeline has reversed China's previous weaknesses in the domain, positioning it as a leader on the global stage.

This development is significant as it underscores China's commitment to becoming a cyber superpower. The focus on practical, hands-on experiences through structured CTF events effectively addresses the nation's talent scarcity and enhances its cybersecurity preparedness. These developments serve as a marker of China's self-reliance in technology and its strategic intent to bolster its cyber capabilities. The implications for other nations, especially Western countries, are profound. Competitive advantage in global cybersecurity could tilt significantly towards China, challenging others to rethink their talent acquisition and training strategies.

In response to China's successful model, organizations in other countries, including the US, may benefit from considering the integration of CTF competitions into academic and professional training. Enhancing collaboration between universities, industry, and the government can create a steady pipeline of cybersecurity professionals equipped with requisite skills. Focusing on practical training and real-world applications in cybersecurity can help address the talent shortage and improve the nation's overall cybersecurity posture. Encouragingly, a shift towards embracing practical experience and fostering linkages within the cybersecurity ecosystem could prove pivotal in developing a robust defense infrastructure.
