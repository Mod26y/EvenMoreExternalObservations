1) The data breach at StreamElements occurred through a third-party service provider that the company had previously discontinued working with. The hacker, known as "victim," leaked sensitive data of 210,000 customers on a hacking forum. The stolen data reportedly included personal details such as full names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. The hacker claimed to have used malware to access the order management system by compromising an employee's internal account. This breach impacted older user data dating back to 2020, and the leak led to subsequent phishing attacks exploiting the incident.

2) This incident underscores the critical importance of continuing to monitor and manage data security even after the termination of third-party service agreements. The breach highlights vulnerabilities in reliance on external vendors and the need for rigorous security due diligence in vendor management. Furthermore, it emphasizes the persistent threat of phishing attacks following data leaks. Since StreamElements collaborates with major brands and prominent streamers, the breach could impair trust and undermine security credibility, potentially affecting existing and future partnerships.

3) In response to this breach, organizations should consider enhancing vendor management policies, especially in terms of data retention and post-agreement data handling. Incident response plans should be refined to address not only ongoing internal threats but also residual risks from past partnerships. Companies are advised to communicate transparently with affected users about potential risks and issue guidance on identifying phishing attempts. Strengthening threat detection mechanisms and employee cybersecurity training to recognize malware risks can be pivotal in preventing account compromises. Moreover, legal teams might assess liabilities concerning data protection obligations with former vendors.
