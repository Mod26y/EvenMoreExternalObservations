1) What happened: While the exact details of the article are inaccessible, we can infer that it discusses advancements beyond the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) in the realm of cyber-threat intelligence. STIX is a standard for sharing cyber threat information, and the title suggests a focus on innovations or enhancements that are pushing the boundaries of current threat intelligence methodologies.

2) Why it matters: Evolving beyond STIX indicates progress in cybersecurity, addressing the limitations of existing frameworks to better detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats. Advancements in threat intelligence enhance an organization's ability to understand complex threats, improve information sharing among entities, and apply robust defenses, reducing the risk landscape for critical infrastructure managed by entities like US counties.

3) What actions should be taken: The steering committee would benefit from keeping abreast of these advancements to ensure the countyâ€™s information security strategies leverage cutting-edge threat intelligence capabilities. Regularly reviewing and updating the cybersecurity framework, incorporating emerging tools, and participating in collaborative networks for information sharing can significantly bolster defenses and resilience against evolving cyber threats. Trainings and workshops for IT staff can also facilitate the integration of new intelligence methodologies.
