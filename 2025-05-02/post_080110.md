**What happened:** While the specific details of the article are inaccessible, the title suggests a significant concern where even organizations with robust cybersecurity frameworks have overlooked potential threats posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). This indicates a gap in recognizing AI as a source of risk, which might involve AI-driven cyber attacks or the misuse of AI technologies within these organizations. The issue reflects an industry-wide paradox where despite having strong defenses, entities fail to anticipate or mitigate AI-related vulnerabilities.

**Why it matters:** As AI technologies become more pervasive and sophisticated, they introduce new attack vectors that traditional cybersecurity measures may not address. Failing to recognize these threats could lead to exploitation by adversaries, result in data breaches, and undermine public trust. Organizations are at a higher risk of financial and reputational damage as AI-based attacks can be more subtle and complex, making detection and response more challenging.

**Actions to be taken:** Organizations should prioritize understanding and integrating AI threat intelligence into their cybersecurity strategy. This involves training teams to recognize AI risks, implementing advanced monitoring tools capable of detecting AI-driven anomalies, and conducting regular AI-focused security audits. Collaborating with AI experts and staying updated with emerging AI threat trends can also bolster preparedness against potential AI threats. Expanding incident response plans to include AI-related scenarios could enhance resilience against such evolving risks.
