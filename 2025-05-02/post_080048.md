1) What happened:

The article presumably discusses insights from the SANS Institute focusing on how cybersecurity responsibilities have expanded beyond the traditional Security Operations Center (SOC). This expansion may highlight new trends, responsibilities, or tools being employed in other parts of an organization, indicating a shift in how cybersecurity is integrated into business processes more broadly.

2) Why it matters:

This evolution in cybersecurity practice is crucial as it implies organizations need to adapt to more dispersed threats by collaborating across departments and integrating security measures into all facets of business operations. This broader integration ensures that cybersecurity isn't siloed, thereby potentially improving overall security posture and making organizations more resilient to modern threats which exploit vulnerabilities across various segments.

3) What actions should be taken:

Organizations should encourage cross-departmental collaboration on cybersecurity efforts and invest in training for non-security staff to better recognize potential threats. Security policies can be expanded to ensure that all facets of operations incorporate security best practices. Continuous evaluation of current security strategies should be undertaken to adapt to this holistic approach, ensuring that new touchpoints and technologies outside the traditional SOC are effectively managed and secured.
