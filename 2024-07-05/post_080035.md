Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-abused-api-to-verify-millions-of-authy-mfa-phone-numbers/

**1) What happened:**

Hackers exploited an API vulnerability in Authy's multi-factor authentication (MFA) system to verify millions of phone numbers. This exploitation shows that malicious actors leveraged the API to confirm the existence and association of phone numbers with Authy accounts. Such an action indicates a systematic attempt to collect valid numbers for further potential misuse or targeted cyberattacks. The scale, involving millions of numbers, exacerbates the concern given the typically critical role MFA systems play in securing user accounts.

**2) Why it matters:**

This incident matters because it directly undermines trust in MFA systems, which are vital for protecting user accounts against unauthorized access. When hackers can verify phone numbers on a large scale, it opens doors for more sophisticated phishing, SIM swapping, and social engineering attacks. Such breaches also risk user privacy and the integrity of accounts secured with Authy, possibly affecting individual users and organizations depending on this service. Compromised MFA systems can lead to severe security incidents across various services relying on Authy for safeguarding sensitive data.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

As a result, it is advisable to review the security of all third-party APIs associated with critical systems. Enhance monitoring to detect unusual API activity and enforce rate limits to mitigate massive data verification attempts. Regularly audit and update API security protocols to minimize exploitation risks. Users should also be encouraged to use alternative MFA methods, and organizations should consider multi-layered authentication mechanisms beyond simple phone number verification. Communicating promptly and transparently with users about the breach and advising on potential security steps can further reinforce overall cybersecurity resilience.
