1) What Happened:
Jennifer VanAntwerp, a seasoned marketing professional, founded "Sober in Cyber" in 2023 to provide alcohol-free networking environments at cybersecurity conferences and events. The initiative aims to support individuals who prefer abstaining from alcohol, either for sobriety or other personal reasons. The initiative also focuses on educating event organizers about providing non-alcoholic options, thus ensuring that professional networking can be inclusive and pressure-free.

2) Why It Matters:
This initiative is significant because it addresses the prevalent culture of alcohol consumption in the cybersecurity industry, which can be a barrier for those who do not drink. The high-stress environment of the industry has led to unhealthy drinking habits for some, as evidenced by a survey indicating a significant portion of cybersecurity professionals consume alcohol excessively. By fostering a more inclusive networking environment, it promotes healthier lifestyle choices and greater inclusivity, potentially improving the overall well-being and engagement of professionals in the industry.

3) Actions to be Taken:
Organizations planning cybersecurity events should consider integrating alcohol-free options and hosting sober gatherings to create an inclusive environment. This would accommodate those who wish to avoid alcohol and promote healthier lifestyles. Event organizers and team leaders should be educated about the importance of such options and encouraged to normalize non-alcoholic beverages at professional gatherings. By doing so, they can foster a welcoming atmosphere that benefits everyone's networking experience, ultimately enhancing participation and satisfaction in industry events.
