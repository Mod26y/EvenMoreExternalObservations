**What happened:**

Ivanti issued security patches for two vulnerabilities in their Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) software, identified as CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428. The vulnerabilities are a medium-severity authentication bypass and a high-severity remote code execution flaw, respectively. These zero-days are being exploited in concert, allowing remote code execution on unsecured systems. Ivanti provides specific updates for the EPMM versions to mitigate these vulnerabilities, affecting primarily on-premises versions. Other Ivanti products, such as Ivanti Neurons for MDM and the cloud-based solutions, remain unaffected.

**Why it matters:**

The ability for threat actors to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution leads to critical security threats, including data breaches, system control, and potential further network exploitation. While the exploitation is currently limited, the exposure risks are significant given the presence of numerous vulnerable instances, notably in countries like the United States and Germany. Past incidents of zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti products suggest a persistent risk pattern, emphasizing the need for vigilance in maintaining cybersecurity hygiene through timely patching.

**What actions should be taken:**

Organizations utilizing Ivanti EPMM should prioritize installing the relevant patches (versions 11.12.0.5, 12.3.0.2, 12.4.0.2, or 12.5.0.1) to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Regularly updating security practices and isolating high-risk systems when necessary can help minimize exposure. Entities impacted should engage Ivanti's support for further incident guidance and monitoring. Proactive threat detection and reporting through platforms like Shadowserver can be advantageous. Organizations should continuously review their endpoint management solutions for potential vulnerabilities and adhere to vendor advisories religiously.
