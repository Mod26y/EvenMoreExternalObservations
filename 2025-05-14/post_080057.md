**1) What happened:**
In May 2025, Microsoft released security updates on their Patch Tuesday addressing 72 vulnerabilities, including five actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities and two publicly disclosed ones. The updates fixed issues across various components, such as remote code execution and elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. Notably, these zero-days involve elevation of privilege and potentially critical remote code execution vulnerabilities in platforms like Edge and Internet Explorer. 

**2) Why it matters:**
This release is critical as it addresses actively exploited vulnerabilities, potentially impacting numerous systems if left unpatched. Elevation of privilege flaws can allow threat actors to gain SYSTEM privileges, significantly compromising the security posture. Organizations use Microsoft products extensively, making them prime targets. Timely patches can thwart potential exploitation, reducing risks of unauthorized access and data breaches.

**3) What actions should be taken:**
Ensure all systems using Microsoft products are promptly updated with the latest patches from the May 2025 release. Prioritize the updates on critical systems that could be severely impacted by these zero-days. Regularly review and update security policies to protect against these specific types of vulnerabilities. Engage in continuous monitoring to detect any signs of exploitation and apply multi-layered security controls to minimize the chances of successful attacks.
