1) What happened: Recently, a threat actor named Machine1337 claimed to possess over 89 million Steam records containing one-time access codes, which they attempted to sell for $5,000. The leaked data seemed to contain historic SMS messages with Steam one-time passcodes facilitated by Twilio’s infrastructure. However, Twilio has denied any breach of their systems, suggesting an alternative theory of a supply-chain compromise. It is proposed that another entity, possibly an SMS provider between Steam and Twilio, might be the origin. Currently, the exact source of the leak remains unverified.

2) Why it matters: The incident highlights significant concerns regarding intermediary vulnerabilities in the software supply chain, emphasizing how third-party systems, like Twilio’s cloud communications, can become attack vectors. With Steam being the largest digital platform for PC games, involving over 120 million monthly users, any security incident can have widespread repercussions, potentially affecting millions of users’ personal and financial information. It serves as a stark reminder for involved companies of the importance of securing all components of their technology stack, including third-party services.

3) What actions should be taken as a result: Organizations leveraging third-party vendors for critical operations such as two-factor authentication should prioritize regular security assessments of their vendors and have incident response plans that address supply-chain threats. It’s advisable for users to enable additional security measures, such as Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator, as suggested, to help safeguard themselves against potential unauthorized access. Regularly monitoring account activity for unusual login attempts can also provide early detection of potential breaches. Lastly, businesses should actively communicate transparent security updates to maintain user trust.
