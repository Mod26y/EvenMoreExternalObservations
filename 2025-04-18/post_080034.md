**What happened:**  
A cybersecurity researcher identified 57 deceptive Chrome extensions affecting 6 million users, which track and monitor browsing activities, access cookies, and potentially execute remote scripts. These extensions appear hidden and are difficult to discover unless with a direct URL, suggesting possible misuse by malicious entities. They veil their true nature by claiming to offer services like ad-blocking or privacy protection, but in reality, possess wide-ranging permissions that raise concerns of spyware behavior.

**Why it matters:**  
With 6 million installations, these extensions pose a significant privacy and security risk. Access to cookies and browsing behaviors could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to accounts, or surveillance, particularly if these are leveraged by malicious actors. Such incidents highlight the importance of scrutinizing browser extensions, the potential risks of widely assumed safe resources, and the necessity for enhanced security measures in extension vetting and monitoring processes, both by developers and end-users.

**Actions to be taken:**  
It's important for organizations and users to regularly audit and assess installed browser extensions, focusing on permissions and credibility. Removal of suspicious extensions is recommended, and in exposed situations, password changes might be prudent. Users should also remain informed about cybersecurity threats and be selective about extensions they install while advocating for more rigorous scrutiny from extension marketplaces like the Chrome Web Store. Meanwhile, organizations should consider implementing policies that control and monitor extension installations on work-related devices.
