1) **What happened:** A vulnerability in Windows (CVE-2025-24054) allowing the capture of NTLM hashes via .library-ms files is being exploited in phishing attacks targeting government and private organizations. Although initially considered low risk, the flaw is actively being used by threat actors, some potentially linked to APT28, to trick users into executing malicious actions that exploit Windows Explorer's handling of library-ms files. This exploitation lets attackers capture NTLM hashes, enabling potential authentication bypass and privilege escalation.

2) **Why it matters:** The use of NTLM in Windows environments continues to be a significant security concern due to its susceptibility to attacks. The exploitation of CVE-2025-24054 to capture NTLM hashes can lead to grave security breaches, including unauthorized access and privilege escalation within organizations. Although considered a medium severity issue, the minimal interaction required to trigger this vulnerability elevates its risk, particularly for government entities and businesses processing sensitive data.

3) **What actions should be taken:** Organizations are encouraged to install Microsoft's March 2025 patches promptly to mitigate this vulnerability. They should evaluate the necessity of NTLM within their networks and disable it if unnecessary, transitioning to more secure protocols like Kerberos. Additionally, enhancing email security measures and conducting user training can further minimize the risks associated with phishing attacks. Organizations should also monitor network traffic for unusual activities, such as unauthorized SMB connections, to identify potential exploitation attempts.
