In this case, Microsoft has identified that after the May 2025 Patch Tuesday update (KB5058379), some Windows 10 systems, including Enterprise LTSC 2021 versions, unexpectedly boot into the BitLocker recovery screen. This issue arises because the installation fails repeatedly, attempting Automatic Repair; however, on systems with BitLocker enabled, the recovery mode is triggered. The problem has been widely reported across various platforms and impacts a range of devices from manufacturers like Lenovo, Dell, and HP.

The significance of this issue lies in its potential to disrupt organizational workflow and systems relying on Windows 10. If systems unexpectedly enter the BitLocker recovery, it can lead to downtime and necessitate technical intervention. With BitLocker as a critical component for data protection, an unexpected recovery mode can also pose risks related to data accessibility, potentially causing concerns around data integrity and security.

As a result, organizations that manage affected devices should consider proactively retrieving and securely storing their BitLocker recovery keys to minimize disruption. It may also be helpful to disable components such as Intel TXT, Secure Boot, or Virtualization Technologies as interim measures, as advised, until Microsoft rolls out a permanent solution. Staying updated with Microsoft's investigation and any forthcoming patches or updates will be crucial to managing and mitigating the issue effectively.
