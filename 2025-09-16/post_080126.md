**What happened:**

Access to the article titled "Building Resilient IT Infrastructure From the Start" was denied due to a 403 Forbidden error. This typically occurs when the server blocks access to the content, either due to permission settings, geographic restrictions, or errors in URL requests. Though the content itself could not be retrieved, the context implies the article focuses on integrating resilience into IT infrastructures from the design phase, discussing strategies to prevent vulnerabilities and enhance security frameworks.

**Why it matters:**

Developing IT infrastructures with inherent resilience is crucial in today's threat landscape, where cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated. By focusing on building security from the ground up, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of breaches and improve their response mechanisms to cyber threats. This approach ensures that security is not an afterthought but a fundamental aspect of system architecture, which is critical in maintaining the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of data in governmental entities like large US County administrations.

**What actions should be taken:**

In light of this topic, information security teams should evaluate their current IT infrastructure to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be reinforced by design improvements. Investing in staff training about emerging threats and innovative architectural approaches will further enhance resilience. Additionally, fostering collaboration with experts to review and upgrade systems with the latest security technologies and practices could fortify defenses against attacks. Regular penetration testing and audits can also help ensure that infrastructural changes are effective in deterring potential threats.
