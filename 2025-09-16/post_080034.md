1) *What happened*: A former employee of FinWise Bank accessed sensitive data from the bank after their employment had ended, causing a data breach. This breach affected 689,000 American First Finance (AFF) customers, whose data may have included their full names and other personal information. FinWise and American First Finance have publicly disclosed the incident, but the specifics of how the ex-employee gained access and the full extent of the exposed data have not been detailed. Following discovery, FinWise involved outside cybersecurity experts to investigate the breach and implemented stronger internal controls.

2) *Why it matters*: This insider breach is significant because it highlights vulnerabilities associated with former employees accessing sensitive information, which poses an ongoing threat to data security. Affected customers face potential risks of identity theft and fraud, compromising their financial security. For businesses, such breaches can lead to legal repercussions and damage to reputation, as evidenced by the multiple class-action lawsuits against FinWise. Moreover, these incidents underline the critical need for robust access management and incident response plans to prevent unauthorized data access and protect stakeholders' interests.

3) *What actions should be taken*: Organizations should conduct thorough audits of access permissions, ensuring that former employees' system access is promptly and effectively revoked. Implementing comprehensive exit procedures can reduce the risk of unauthorized access. Regular staff training on security protocols and threat awareness is equally important. Additionally, companies should maintain transparent communication with customers about breaches and provide support measures, such as credit monitoring services. Investing in advanced monitoring tools and engaging with cybersecurity professionals to bolster defense strategies can further mitigate risks and enhance data protection frameworks.
