**What happened:**

Check Point researchers uncovered a significant remote code execution vulnerability, designated CVE-2024-38112, that impacts Microsoft Windows and Windows Server users. Attackers exploit this vulnerability by using Windows Internet Shortcut files to bring users to URLs that utilize the retired Internet Explorer browser. This method leverages Internet Explorer's weaker security to easily launch malicious extensions. Additionally, attackers trick users into running harmful `.hta` applications by disguising them as PDFs. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has classified this vulnerability as high-severity and has demanded urgent updates to federal systems. Despite a patch released by Microsoft on July 9, some exploitations of this vulnerability date back over a year.

**Why it matters:**

The exploitation of CVE-2024-38112 poses a substantial threat to Microsoft Windows users, given Internet Explorer's outdated and less secure nature compared to modern browsers. The attackers' methods—using Internet Shortcut files and disguised malicious applications—exploit user misconceptions, making them more effective. With CISA highlighting its high-severity status and the significant number of endpoints still lacking proper protection and patch management, there is a considerable risk of widespread exploitation, particularly within organizations with inadequate cybersecurity measures. The exploitation of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized remote access, data breaches, and other severe cyber incidents.

**Actions to take:**

Organizations should prioritize applying the patch issued by Microsoft on July 9 to mitigate the vulnerability. Additionally, they should conduct a thorough review of their security controls, particularly focusing on endpoint protection and patch management systems to ensure full coverage. Security awareness training for employees can help counteract tactics that rely on social engineering, such as disguised file downloads. Given the severity and active exploitation of this vulnerability, IT teams need to monitor their networks closely for any signs of malicious activity. Finally, it is advisable to review and potentially disable or restrict the use of Internet Explorer within the organization to reduce exposure to similar risks in the future.
