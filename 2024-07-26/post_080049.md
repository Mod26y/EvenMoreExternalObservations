### What Happened
Cybercriminals have capitalized on the recent CrowdStrike outage, leveraging it for a series of targeted phishing attacks against the company's customers. These attacks have involved registering phishing and typosquatting domains to mislead victims into downloading malicious software, such as HijackLoader and the RemCos RAT. Additionally, threat actors have distributed phishing emails posing as technical support or competing vendors, with one campaign attributed to the pro-Hamas group "Handala" employing wiper malware to target Israeli organizations.

### Why It Matters
This event underscores the heightened risk of social engineering attacks following high-profile service outages, particularly targeting technically adept users such as those affiliated with CrowdStrike. The scale and specificity of these attacks are unusual, posing significant cybersecurity hazards to organizations and highlighting weaknesses in post-outage response and user awareness. The incident further illustrates how such cyber threats can be weaponized for political aims, increasing the stakes for adequate cybersecurity measures.

### What Actions Should Be Taken
Organizations should enhance their vigilance and cybersecurity defenses in the wake of high-profile outages. Implementing blocklists and protective DNS tools can mitigate the risk of accessing malicious domains. Additionally, it is crucial to train employees to seek technical support only through official channels. Monitoring and filtering email communications for signs of phishing attacks can also decrease the likelihood of successful breaches. Given the tendency of such campaigns to last a couple of weeks, maintaining heightened security measures for an extended period post-outage is advisable.
