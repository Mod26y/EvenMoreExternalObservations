### What Happened

The article discusses a malware campaign dubbed "Voldemort," which targets organizations globally by masquerading as tax authorities from Europe, Asia, and the US. This campaign, active since August 5, involves more than 20,000 phishing messages and features a custom backdoor malware written in C. The malware conducts data exfiltration and can deploy additional payloads. Notably, it uses Google Sheets for command and control communications. On August 17, the campaign escalated significantly, with nearly 6,000 phishing emails sent in a single day, primarily impersonating tax agencies like the IRS, UK's HM Revenue & Customs, and France's Direction Générale des Finances Publiques.

### Why It Matters

This campaign matters because it represents a sophisticated and highly credible threat targeting sensitive operations and data within organizations globally. The use of legitimate domains, native language in the phishing lures, and genuine software for malicious operations (e.g., WebEx) makes the attack harder to detect and prevent. Moreover, the potential espionage aims of the campaign could have severe consequences for targeted organizations, including data breaches, loss of intellectual property, and disruption of operations. Given its reliance on abusing popular services like Google Sheets, organizations using these platforms are at increased risk.

### Actions To Be Taken

Organizations should first enhance email filtering systems and train employees to recognize and report suspicious emails to mitigate the risk of phishing attacks. Implementing strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) can add an extra layer of security. Regularly updating and auditing publicly available information can help reduce exposure. Advanced endpoint detection and response tools should be employed to detect abnormal behavior, along with strict network segmentation and regular security patches. Monitoring specifically for traffic to cloud services associated with non-browser processes and verifying the authenticity of communications from tax authorities via separate, known-good channels can further mitigate risks. Establishing user awareness and robust email authentication protocols (DMARC, SPF, DKIM) is also crucial.
