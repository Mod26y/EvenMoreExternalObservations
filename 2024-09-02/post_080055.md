### What Happened

Check Point Software and Cisco have both announced new acquisitions to enhance their AI-based cybersecurity capabilities. Check Point is acquiring Cyberint to improve its external risk management and threat intelligence offerings, while Cisco is buying Robust Intelligence, a startup that specializes in AI model validation and protection. Both deals are set to close soon and will expand the companiesâ€™ cybersecurity portfolios, particularly in areas involving AI-driven threat detection and risk management.

### Why It Matters

These acquisitions are significant because they highlight the growing importance of AI in cybersecurity. As businesses increasingly deploy AI-enabled applications, the associated risks, including potential data theft and model vulnerabilities, become more pronounced. The acquisitions by Check Point and Cisco aim to address these challenges, enhancing their platforms with advanced AI capabilities. This is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and offering comprehensive security solutions that meet the evolving needs of enterprises in an AI-driven world.

### Actions to be Taken

Organizations should closely monitor these developments and consider bolstering their own AI-driven security measures. Evaluating the offerings from Check Point and Cisco post-acquisition could provide valuable insights into emerging best practices for AI model security and external risk management. Additionally, integrating advanced threat intelligence and robust AI validation tools into existing security frameworks may help mitigate risks associated with AI applications. Proactive adoption of these technologies can enhance overall security posture and ensure the safe deployment of AI-driven innovations.
