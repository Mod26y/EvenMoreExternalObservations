### What Happened

APT29, a well-known Russian-backed threat actor group, has carried out multiple exploit campaigns using n-day mobile exploits previously employed by commercial spyware vendors like Intellexa and NSO Group. These exploits were deployed through watering hole attacks on the websites of Mongoliaâ€™s Cabinet and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Infected websites used vulnerabilities in iOS and Chrome on Android to hijack visitors' devices. Google's Threat Analysis Group noted that while the attackers' acquisition method of these exploits is unclear, the campaigns appeared on three occasions, leveraging recently patched vulnerabilities.

### Why It Matters

The use of exploits originally crafted by commercial surveillance vendors by APT29 underscores the risk posed when such sophisticated tools fall into the hands of APT actors. This highlights a concerning trend where commercial spyware makes its way to state-sponsored groups, thereby amplifying the threats to governmental and critical infrastructure targets. Failure to rapidly update and patch systems leaves entities vulnerable to advanced cyber espionage activities, especially when these exploits are re-deployed as n-day vulnerabilities by malicious actors.

### What Actions Should Be Taken

To mitigate these threats, it is crucial for organizations, especially those in government and critical sectors, to adopt robust patch management processes to swiftly address vulnerabilities. Continuous monitoring of software updates and threat intelligence feeds can help identify and mitigate emerging threats. Furthermore, implementing advanced web security tools and conducting regular security assessments of significant public-facing websites can prevent successful exploit execution. Additionally, fostering relationships with security researchers and threat intelligence groups can provide early warnings and actionable insights into evolving attack patterns.
