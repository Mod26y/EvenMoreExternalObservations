**1) What happened:**

NASA is increasing its focus on the cybersecurity of its mission-critical software to reduce risks related to its missions. The agency’s Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Facility has traditionally reviewed software for bugs but has now expanded its role to identify cybersecurity risks in software and ground systems. The IV&V facility is currently staffed by about 12 practitioners but plans to grow its team. Additionally, NASA is expanding its cybersecurity educational outreach to include internships and integration into existing focus areas, aiming to bolster the cybersecurity workforce.

**2) Why it matters:**

NASA's emphasis on cybersecurity is crucial for protecting sensitive space missions that could be compromised by software vulnerabilities. Considering cybersecurity risks early in the software evaluation process helps prevent potential mission failures and breaches. Furthermore, NASA’s educational outreach efforts are significant because they recognize the broader necessity of addressing the cybersecurity talent gap, which is essential for both aerospace and general technology-dependent infrastructure. Strengthening the cybersecurity workforce not only benefits NASA but also enhances national security and business continuity as technology reliance increases.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

The county's information security steering committee could draw lessons from NASA's proactive approach by integrating cybersecurity assessments more deeply into its software review processes. Expanding educational outreach to develop future cybersecurity professionals might also be considered, perhaps through partnerships with local educational institutions and internship programs. Moreover, a framework should be established for regularly evaluating and updating cybersecurity measures, ensuring alignment with emerging threats and technologies. This holistic approach can enhance the county's resilience against cyber threats, securing critical infrastructures and services provided to its residents.
