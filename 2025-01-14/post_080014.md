**1) What happened:**  
OneBlood, a not-for-profit blood donation organization, experienced a ransomware attack in July 2024, during which hackers encrypted their virtual machines and stole donor information. The breach forced OneBlood to revert to manual processes, leading to delays in blood-related services and triggering urgent donation protocols. Following a prolonged investigation, OneBlood confirmed unauthorized access from July 14 to July 29, 2024, during which files containing names and Social Security numbers were copied. Despite the attack occurring in July, data breach notifications were sent to affected individuals only in December 2024.

**2) Why it matters:**  
This incident is significant because it highlights vulnerabilities in critical healthcare infrastructure, posing both operational and security risks. The theft of sensitive donor data, including Social Security numbers, poses long-term risks of identity theft and financial fraud. Additionally, the delayed notification period left individuals potentially unaware and unprepared to mitigate identity-related risks. The attack also disrupted healthcare services, underscoring the potential for collateral damage within the healthcare supply chain, affecting patient care due to shortages of essential medical supplies, like blood.

**3) What actions should be taken:**  
In response to the ransomware attack on OneBlood, organizations should enhance their cybersecurity measures by implementing robust encryption for sensitive data and maintaining secure backup systems to reduce operational disruption. Regular training programs for employees on recognizing phishing attempts and other security threats can be beneficial. Affected individuals are advised to utilize free credit monitoring and consider placing credit freezes and fraud alerts on their accounts. Organizations should also strive for transparent and timely communication following a breach to help mitigate potential harm to those impacted. Engaging in penetration testing and continuous monitoring can also help identify and address potential security gaps.
