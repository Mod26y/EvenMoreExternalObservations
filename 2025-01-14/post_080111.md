**What happened:**
Threat actors have been exploiting a critical vulnerability in Aviatrix Controller, denoted as CVE-2024-50603, to execute unauthorized remote commands. Discovered in October 2024, this flaw is due to inadequate input sanitization in API functions, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands. Impacted systems are being manipulated to install backdoors and crypto miners, facilitating unauthorized Monero mining through XMRig. Although a small percentage (3%) of cloud enterprises use Aviatrix Controller, unpatched systems represent significant security concerns, potentially paving the way for further network infiltration tactics.

**Why it matters:**
The exploitation of CVE-2024-50603 poses substantial risks to organizations utilizing Aviatrix Controller, potentially leading to illegal crypto mining, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access to cloud environments. Given that a notable portion of affected deployments have paths allowing administrative cloud control plane access (65%), there's a critical risk for privilege escalation and lateral movement within organizations' networks. While no evidence of lateral movement exists yet, early detection and mitigation are crucial to preventing potential damage and data breaches that could seriously impact operational integrity and data security.

**What actions should be taken:**
Organizations using Aviatrix Controller should urgently upgrade to versions 7.1.4191 or 7.2.4996 to mitigate CVE-2024-50603 vulnerability risks. It's crucial to ensure that patches remain applied even if the system is downgraded and to implement CoPilot version 4.16.1 or higher. Security teams should immediately evaluate their Aviatrix Controller exposure, particularly ensuring port 443 is not publicly accessible, and strictly adhere to recommended IP access guidelines to minimize attack exposure. Regular vulnerability assessments and monitoring should be conducted to swiftly detect potential threats and lateral movement attempts.
