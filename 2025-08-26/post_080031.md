The GreyNoise report details a significant surge in scanning activity targeting Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) auth servers, with nearly 1,971 IP addresses probing these systems simultaneously, suggesting a coordinated reconnaissance effort. The scans appear to exploit timing flaws to verify usernames, potentially setting up future credential-based attacks like brute force or password-spray attacks. The majority of IP addresses share a common signature and originate from Brazil, predominantly targeting US systems, indicating possible coordination by a botnet or toolset.

This spike in RDP scanning is significant as it coincides with the US back-to-school season, exposing schools, universities, and other institutions to heightened cybersecurity risks. These environments often have predictable username formats, making them particularly vulnerable to enumeration attacks. Additionally, the surge could hint at an undisclosed vulnerability in RDP systems, as past increases in malicious traffic have preceded public disclosures of new vulnerabilities.

To mitigate risks, administrators of RDP portals should enhance their security posture by enabling multi-factor authentication and possibly placing these systems behind Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Regular monitoring for unusual activity, such as the spike noted, should be prioritized, and systems should be promptly updated to protect against emerging threats. Conducting security awareness training, particularly in educational institutions, can also help prevent potential breaches.
