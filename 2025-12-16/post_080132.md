This alliance focuses on integrating cybersecurity within day-to-day operations to maintain operational excellence. The collaboration ensures that security initiatives are aligned with business objectives, potentially reducing the risk of disruptions caused by cyber threats and enhancing the organization's resilience against attacks.

Conducting joint risk assessments and implementing cross-functional training can enhance understanding and responsiveness to incidents. By establishing clear protocols for incident management, organizations can improve their ability to quickly contain and mitigate potential threats. Additionally, fostering a culture of security awareness across all departments can further strengthen the organization's defenses and support the sustainability of operational excellence.
