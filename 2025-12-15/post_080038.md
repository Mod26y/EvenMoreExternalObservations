**1) What happened?**

Coupang, South Korea's largest online retailer, experienced a massive data breach affecting 33.7 million customers, attributed to a former employee who retained system access post-employment. The breach, which exposed customers' personal and order information, remained undetected from June 24, 2025, until November 18, when Coupang initiated an internal investigation. Seoul Metropolitan Police, after raiding Coupang's offices, linked the breach to a 43-year-old former employee, highlighting vulnerabilities in the company's system. Though Coupang maintains that leaked data hasn't surfaced online, the incident has prompted significant phishing campaigns in the country.

**2) Why it matters?**

This breach underscores the critical risk posed by inadequate offboarding procedures and the importance of properly managing access permissions. The incident not only resulted in exposure of sensitive data but also incited widespread phishing attacks, affecting millions in South Korea. Additionally, the breach prompted significant leadership changes at Coupang and potential legal repercussions for the company, serving as a stark reminder of the devastating effects of cybersecurity negligence. It highlights the need for robust internal security practices, particularly regarding access management and monitoring, to prevent similar breaches.

**3) What actions should be taken?**

Organizations should immediately re-evaluate their access management protocols, ensuring that all former employees have their system access revoked promptly upon departure. Implementing continuous monitoring of access activities and regular audits of access logs can help detect unauthorized access attempts early. Companies could also enhance cybersecurity training to reduce the risk of phishing attacks, including practicing rapid identification and response strategies. Collaborating with law enforcement to understand how such breaches occur can further inform preventive measures. Furthermore, organizations could refine incident response plans to minimize downtime and data exposure should a breach occur.
