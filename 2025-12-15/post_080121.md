This move also underscores a growing trend of incorporating AI into cybersecurity, reflecting the technology's ability to adapt quickly to evolving threats.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
Organizations using M365 Enterprise licenses might consider evaluating the capabilities of Security Copilot to ensure they fully leverage its features. Security teams could also plan for technical integration and training to maximize the tool's effectiveness. It would be prudent to assess existing security measures alongside this new capability to streamline operations and enhance security resilience. Organizations may also need to stay informed about updates and best practices related to this tool to adapt swiftly to any changes or new features.
