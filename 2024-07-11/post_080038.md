Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vipersoftx-malware-covertly-runs-powershell-using-autoit-scripting/

**What happened:**
The ViperSoftX malware has been discovered leveraging AutoIT scripting to covertly execute PowerShell commands. This malware typically infiltrates systems via software cracks, key generators, or malicious websites. Once it infects a system, it uses AutoIT scripts, a scripting language intended for automating Windows GUI tasks, to secretly run PowerShell commands. This method allows the malware to evade traditional security measures, mask its presence, and potentially spread deeper into the compromised network.

**Why it matters:**
This development represents a significant threat to cybersecurity defenses because it combines the stealthiness of AutoIT scripting with the powerful, versatile capabilities of PowerShell. By doing so, ViperSoftX can conduct a variety of malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, downloading additional payloads, or establishing a backdoor for remote control. The sophistication of using dual scripting languages makes it harder for detection by standard antivirus and anti-malware tools, increasing the potential for prolonged undetected operation within a network.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**
Organizations are encouraged to enhance their endpoint protection strategies by incorporating behavioral analysis tools that can detect unusual scripting activities. Regularly updating and patching software can help reduce vulnerabilities exploited by such malware. Implementing strict controls over the execution of unauthorized scripts and limiting the use of PowerShell to administrative users can mitigate risk. Continuous monitoring and logging of PowerShell usage and AutoIT processes can provide early detection of suspicious activity, enabling quicker response and containment of potential threats. Education and training for employees on the dangers of downloading unverified software and cracks could also reduce the likelihood of initial infection.
