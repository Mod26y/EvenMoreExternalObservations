1) **What happened:**
Gen, a global leader in cybersecurity, launched an educational campaign titled "Scam Artists," which uses creative artwork to depict the emotional toll of cybercrime. Collaborating with psychologist Lee Chambers, the campaign featured three victims of scams and identity theft, who wore EEG headsets while recalling their experiences. The brain activity recorded was transformed into visual art, showcasing the intense emotional responses to cybercrime and the subsequent relief after being introduced to cyber protection solutions. Additionally, new research revealed that a significant number of Americans feel vulnerable to cybercrime, yet many are not using adequate cybersecurity measures.

2) **Why it matters:**
This initiative is crucial for raising awareness about the profound emotional impacts of cybercrime, which often go unrecognized. Highlighting the psychological toll provides a more comprehensive understanding of why cybersecurity is essential, beyond just financial and data loss. It underscores the need for individuals to take proactive steps to protect themselves online. The campaign also exposes a gap in cybersecurity adoption, revealing a significant portion of the population feels vulnerable yet remains underprotected, thus emphasizing the importance of addressing human behavior in cybersecurity strategies.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
Given the findings, the County's Information Security Steering Committee could consider launching similar awareness campaigns to highlight the emotional and psychological effects of cybercrime on its constituents. Educational programs that include personal stories and psychological insights could be developed to promote proactive cybersecurity behaviors. The committee might also evaluate current cybersecurity measures within county systems and community outreach programs to ensure they align with the latest security needs. Additionally, investing in tools and resources to mitigate optimism bias and encourage the adoption of comprehensive cybersecurity solutions can help in establishing a robust defensive posture against cyberthreats.
