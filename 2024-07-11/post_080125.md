1) The collaboration between Saviynt and Ernst & Young LLP aims to enhance external user management through Saviynt's Identity Cloud solution. This partnership is intended to streamline the identity lifecycle of third-party entities such as external workers and suppliers. The integrated solution will provide a delegated onboarding workflow, better identity proofing, improved risk management, and more effective off-boarding processes, addressing a significant gap in existing identity and access management tools.

2) This collaboration is significant because it addresses the longstanding issue of inadequate tools for managing external identities, which are increasingly critical for modern organizations. Effective management of third-party access enhances security, ensures compliance with regulatory standards, and can reduce operational costs. By providing a cohesive and streamlined process, the solution promises to turn identity and access management into a strategic advantage rather than just a compliance requirement.

3) Organizations should consider evaluating their current third-party identity management processes in light of this new offering. Engaging with both Saviynt and EY could be beneficial to understand how their combined solution might integrate with existing systems. Additionally, businesses can attend the Saviynt and EY webinars to gain deeper insights and potentially participate in pilot programs to test the new capabilities. Continuous monitoring and assessment of identity and access management strategies should be prioritized to ensure they evolve with emerging threats and compliance requirements.
