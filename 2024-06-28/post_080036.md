### 1. What happened?

AU10TIX, a company specializing in identity verification, exposed personal user data for 18 months due to compromised credentials. The data, belonging to users from major apps like TikTok, X, LinkedIn, and others, consisted of names, birth dates, and images of ID documents. A security researcher found these exposed credentials online and revealed that the credentials had been stolen by malware in December 2022 and posted to Telegram by March 2023. Although AU10TIX claimed to have investigated and revoked the compromised credentials, the data remained exposed.

### 2. Why it matters?

This data exposure has severe implications for user privacy and security, highlighting vulnerabilities in third-party identity verification services. Sensitive personal information can be exploited by cybercriminals for identity theft, fraud, and other malicious activities. This incident underscores the risks associated with entrusting personal documents to third-party vendors, especially when robust security measures are not properly enforced and monitored. It also brings into question the effectiveness of AU10TIX's and similar companies' incident response and data protection practices.

### 3. What actions should be taken as a result of this information?

Organizations using third-party identity verification services should review their vendor risk management processes and ensure that these vendors adhere to stringent security practices. Incorporating advanced techniques such as tokenization, zero-knowledge proofs, and decentralized identity verification can mitigate risks. Continuous monitoring and regular security audits of third-party vendors will help identify and address potential vulnerabilities timely. Affected organizations should also communicate with their users regarding potential risks and encourage them to monitor their personal information for signs of misuse. Enhanced internal training on credential management and timely revocation practices is also advisable.
