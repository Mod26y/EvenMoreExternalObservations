**1) What happened:**

A new attack method called "DoubleClickjacking" exploits users' double-clicks to perform unauthorized actions on legitimate websites. Unlike traditional clickjacking, which involves hidden iframes from attacker-created pages, DoubleClickjacking overlays a legitimate page without using iframes or passing cookies. When a user tries to solve a captcha or similar prompt, the timing of their double-click is manipulated so the second click inadvertently authorizes a sensitive action on the legitimate site. This attack bypasses existing defenses and can impact a wide array of sites including Shopify, Slack, and Salesforce accounts.

**2) Why it matters:**

DoubleClickjacking is significant because it bypasses existing clickjacking defenses, exposing a wide range of popular platforms and potentially any site with sensitive user interactions to attack. The methodology utilized directly interacts with legitimate web pages, making detection more challenging and defenses less effective. The threat's prevalence across numerous sites, and its potential for adapting to browser extensions and mobile devices, raises security concerns across sectors reliant on secure web interactions, often risking unauthorized access to critical accounts, sensitive data, and secure installations.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should review and integrate protective JavaScript shared by the researcher to delay action on sensitive buttons until a user gesture is confirmed. Implementing HTTP headers to limit rapid context-switching during double-click sequences can provide additional safeguards. Continuous monitoring of security updates and research can help identify and mitigate new vulnerabilities. Engaging in regular user education and awareness programs will further reduce susceptibility to such attacks. Partnerships with cybersecurity firms to develop dynamic and responsive defenses against evolving threats should be considered.
