**1) What happened:**  
VicOne and the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) announced their collaboration to co-host the "Pwn2Own Automotive 2025" event, scheduled for January 22-24, 2025, in Tokyo. This event focuses on identifying zero-day vulnerabilities in automotive technologies. Building on its previous success, the contest invites security researchers to discover vulnerabilities in key automotive components, such as Tesla systems, infotainment platforms, EV chargers, and operating systems. Successful participants will be rewarded monetarily, thereby encouraging further exploration and innovation within automotive cybersecurity.

**2) Why it matters:**  
The event highlights the increasing significance of cybersecurity in the automotive industry, especially with the rise of software-defined vehicles. As these vehicles become more prevalent, they present new security challenges. Addressing zero-day vulnerabilities is crucial to preempt potential cyber-attacks that could compromise vehicle safety and user data. By motivating researchers with financial incentives and recognition, the contest fosters advancements in securing automotive systems, ultimately contributing to safer vehicle technologies globally.

**3) What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations in the automotive industry may consider engaging with events like Pwn2Own to stay ahead of potential security threats. Collaboration with cybersecurity experts could help in early vulnerability detection and risk mitigation. Investing in robust cybersecurity training and tools for in-house teams could be beneficial. Additionally, companies should monitor advancements shared at this event, leveraging insights to strengthen their own systems and preparing response plans for potential vulnerabilities through partnerships similar to those between VicOne and ZDI.
