Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-3-million-mail-servers-without-encryption-exposed-to-sniffing-attacks/

1) **What happened:** A report from ShadowServer reveals that over 3.3 million mail servers running POP3/IMAP are not using TLS encryption, leaving email communications vulnerable to sniffing attacks. Without TLS, emails, including usernames and passwords, are transmitted as plain text, enabling potential eavesdropping and unauthorized access through sniffing or password guessing attacks. ShadowServer is currently notifying affected server operators to enable TLS, suggesting an upgrade to protect sensitive information.

2) **Why it matters:** The absence of TLS encryption on such a vast number of mail servers poses significant risks to users' privacy and organizational security. Eavesdroppers can intercept sensitive information, which can lead to data breaches, account compromise, or other cybersecurity incidents. This vulnerability is especially concerning given the ubiquity of email usage for personal and professional communication, making it an appealing target for cybercriminals. Insecure servers expose organizations to unnecessary risks and can undermine trust with users.

3) **What actions should be taken:** Organizations with mail servers should assess their current email server configurations to ensure TLS encryption is enabled for both POP3 and IMAP services, using modern versions like TLS 1.2 or 1.3. It is advisable to regularly audit network security posture and update configurations according to the latest cybersecurity standards. Additionally, organizations may consider implementing VPNs for additional security, conducting user awareness training on the risks of transmitting unprotected data, and possibly contemplating whether certain services need to remain publicly accessible.
