1) **What happened:**
The article discusses the difficulties Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) face when communicating cyber-risk to leadership teams. Traditional methods like heat maps and risk registers often fail to capture the nuances of cyber-risk. The article introduces the concept of a proximity resilience graph as a more effective tool for CISOs to convey these risks. This visual tool maps an organization's cybersecurity resilience and threat proximity, making it easier for leadership to grasp the specifics of their cyber-risk posture and investments.

2) **Why it matters:**
Effective communication of cyber-risk is crucial, especially given the rising costs and incidence of data breaches. If CISOs cannot effectively convey these risks, leadership may deprioritize cybersecurity investments, leaving organizations vulnerable. The introduction of tools like the proximity resilience graph helps bridge the communication gap, making it easier to integrate cyber-risk into broader business risk considerations. This, in turn, enhances informed decision-making and prioritization of cybersecurity measures, ultimately fortifying the organization's defense against cyber threats.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
Organizations should encourage their CISOs to adopt more effective communication tools like the proximity resilience graph. Training sessions on creating and using such graphs could be beneficial. CISOs should actively involve their leadership teams in understanding and interpreting these new tools to ensure maximum engagement and comprehension. Regular reviews using these tools could help keep cybersecurity on the leadership's radar and drive more informed, timely decisions regarding cybersecurity investments and strategies. This proactive approach supports better resilience and alignment with organizational priorities.
