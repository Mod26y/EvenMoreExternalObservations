1. **What happened:**
   Security researchers discovered a new method, termed "Revival Hijack," by which attackers distribute malware through the PyPI package repository. The technique involves re-registering malicious packages under the names of previously legitimate but now removed packages. This exploitation is possible because PyPI allows reuse of names of removed packages. Attackers use this vulnerability to infect systems by getting these packages automatically downloaded by CI/CD systems, under the guise that these are legitimate updates of previously safe packages.

2. **Why it matters:**
   The Revival Hijack technique represents a significant supply chain threat, as it doesn't rely on typical methods like typosquatting or cloning to trick users into downloading malware. This method can affect CI/CD systems that might automatically download these malicious packages, leading to widespread infection across various environments. The scale of the threat is highlighted by the fact that there are around 120,000 vulnerable packages that could be hijacked, with 22,000 being highly popular. This underscores the necessity of improving package repository security practices to prevent malicious actors from exploiting this loophole.

3. **What actions should be taken:**
   Organizations using PyPI should adopt enhanced vigilance towards updates of previously safe packages, examining any changes or anomalies before deployment. They should also consider implementing strict internal policies for verifying package integrity and authenticity. CI/CD systems should be configured to avoid automatic trust in previously removed packages that reappear. Additionally, PyPI and similar repositories could benefit from policy changes, such as prohibiting the reuse of abandoned package names to mitigate Revival Hijack risks. Conducting regular security audits on package dependencies and integrating these findings into the organization's risk assessment processes would also be advantageous.
