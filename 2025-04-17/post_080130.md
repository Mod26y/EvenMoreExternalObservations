1) **What happened:** The ransomware group known as 'CrazyHunter' has been reportedly targeting critical organizations in Taiwan. This could involve attacks on infrastructure such as hospitals, government services, or major businesses, leveraging malicious software to encrypt data and extort payments in exchange for decryption keys.

Monitoring and intelligence-sharing with other entities may help in preemptively identifying and mitigating such threats.
