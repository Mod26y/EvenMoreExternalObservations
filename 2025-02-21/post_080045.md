1) The article discusses a report by ZEST Security that highlights a significant issue in cloud security management: 62% of security incidents stem from risks already known to the organization. This indicates a persistent gap between risk recognition and incident prevention. Organizations are aware of vulnerabilities but fail to adequately address or mitigate them, leading to security breaches.

2) This information is critical as it underlines the importance of proactive risk management. Ignoring known vulnerabilities creates a false sense of security and leaves room for attacks that could have been prevented. It underscores the need for organizations to prioritize risk assessment and mitigation as part of their cybersecurity strategy.

3) Organizations could benefit from revisiting their risk management frameworks to ensure known vulnerabilities are not overlooked. Regular updates to risk assessments and immediate mitigation efforts for known risks could be emphasized. Enhanced monitoring and a focus on incident response readiness can aid in swiftly addressing any arising threats, potentially reducing the occurrence of preventable incidents.
