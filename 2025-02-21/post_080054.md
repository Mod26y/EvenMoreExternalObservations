It may highlight behaviors or attitudes within companies that inadvertently lead to increased vulnerabilities. These could include complacency, lack of awareness, insufficient communication between departments, or inadequate emphasis on cybersecurity training and policies.

2) Understanding the cultural factors that undermine cybersecurity is crucial because an organization's culture can significantly affect how employees perceive and respond to cyber threats.
