**What happened:**  
Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) and Centene Corporation paid $11,253,400 to settle allegations over non-compliance with cybersecurity requirements under a Defense Health Agency (DHA) TRICARE contract. From 2015 to 2018, HNFS allegedly failed to implement required cybersecurity measures while providing healthcare support services and falsely certified compliance. They did not conduct necessary vulnerability scans, consider audit findings, or implement critical management and security controls, despite submitting compliance reports on several occasions. While HNFS and Centene deny these allegations, they agreed to pay the settlement.

**Why it matters:**  
This case underscores the critical nature of maintaining transparency and integrity in cybersecurity practices, particularly in sectors handling sensitive information such as healthcare. The alleged lapses highlight vulnerabilities that could potentially expose sensitive data of military service members. The substantial settlement payment reflects the severe repercussions organizations may face when neglecting contractual cybersecurity obligations. It serves as a reminder of the importance of fulfilling cybersecurity commitments to protect sensitive personal information and uphold trust with stakeholders and governmental entities.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations should prioritize adhering to cybersecurity standards and obligations specified in contracts, especially when handling sensitive data. Establishing robust internal processes for regular vulnerability scanning, timely patching, and risk mitigation based on audit findings is crucial. Implementing industry-standard asset management, access control, and firewall protections would help fortify defenses. Reviewing and updating password policies and replacing outdated hardware and software are also essential. Organizations should ensure they conduct regular compliance reviews, documenting and addressing any security gaps, to verify that they are accurately certifying their cybersecurity status in reports.
