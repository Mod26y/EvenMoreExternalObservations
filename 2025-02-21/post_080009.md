**1) What happened:**

Apiiro has launched two open-source tools aimed at mitigating supply chain attacks by detecting and blocking malicious code before it is integrated into software projects. The tools include a comprehensive ruleset for Semgrep and Opengrep that targets malicious code patterns and a GitHub-integrated scanner called PRevent that analyzes pull requests for suspicious code. These tools offer a high detection accuracy with minimal false positives, making them effective in identifying code patterns that may be uncommon or indicative of malware behavior.

**2) Why it matters:**

This development is crucial as supply chain attacks are increasingly targeting software development processes, where malicious code can be discreetly merged into projects, potentially spreading to many end users. The release of such effective detection tools helps organizations better secure their development pipelines and reduce the risk of compromised software. By identifying suspicious code patterns and preventing them from merging into the main codebase, these tools bolster an organizationâ€™s defense against threats that could lead to data breaches or system compromises.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations involved in software development can consider integrating Apiiro's tools into their CI/CD pipeline to enhance their security posture. By doing so, they can proactively identify and mitigate the risk of malicious code merges. Additionally, development teams should stay informed on updates and new features, such as deep code analysis, that Apiiro plans to include in future versions. Furthermore, organizations should conduct independent testing of these tools to evaluate their effectiveness and compatibility with existing systems, ensuring that they align with specific operational needs and security standards.
