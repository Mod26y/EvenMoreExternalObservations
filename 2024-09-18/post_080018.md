### What Happened:

Hackers have been targeting construction firms by brute-forcing passwords on exposed Foundation accounting servers, particularly those with weak or default credentials. The attacks utilize open ports, specifically TCP port 4243, which exposes Microsoft SQL Servers configured for the accounting software. Once access is gained, attackers execute commands via SQL queries to gather insights and possibly infiltrate further. Approximately 500 hosts running the targeted software were identified, with 33 publicly exposing databases containing default admin credentials. Huntress notified the software vendor, who confirmed the issue pertains to its on-premise version only.

### Why It Matters:

This incident holds significant implications for information security within the construction industry and beyond. Such breaches can result in unauthorized access to sensitive financial data, intellectual property theft, and operational disruptions. The vulnerability highlights the risks associated with outdated security practices, such as retaining default passwords and exposing critical services unnecessarily. This breach not only compromises company data but also demonstrates hackers' persistent and aggressive efforts to exploit weak security measures, thereby stressing the necessity for robust cybersecurity protocols.

### Actions to Take:

To mitigate risks, several measures should be prioritized. Organizations are advised to change default passwords to strong, unique passwords and regularly update them. It is also crucial to close or secure unnecessary open ports to minimize exposure to brute-force attacks. Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts can add an extra layer of protection. Regular vulnerability assessments and security audits should be conducted to identify and remediate weaknesses. Additionally, deploying intrusion detection and prevention systems will help monitor and neutralize such threats in real-time. Promoting cybersecurity awareness and training among employees may further reduce the risk of falling prey to such attacks.
