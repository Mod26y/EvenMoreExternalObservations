### What Happened
Hydden, a startup in the identity management sector, emerged from stealth with $4.4 million in seed funding led by Access Venture Partners. The company offers a platform that enhances visibility across an organization's identity environment, integrating with existing identity and access management solutions, cloud applications, and on-premises applications. The platform aims to address gaps in identity management by creating a unified data layer encompassing identity access management, identity governance, privileged access management, and identity threat detection. One notable feature is its "time capsule" functionality, useful for identifying patterns and aiding in post-event analysis.

### Why It Matters
In todayâ€™s increasingly hybrid and cloud-centric IT environments, identity has become the new perimeter. Managing a diverse array of identities, especially non-human accounts, is a significant challenge for organizations. Gaps in identity management, like over-privileged accounts and misconfigured authentication, can expose critical vulnerabilities. Hydden addresses these issues by ensuring organizations have complete visibility into their identities, accounts, and privileges. This continuous, real-time monitoring and detection of identity-related risks is essential for proactive threat management, thereby helping to alleviate the enormous pressure faced by CISOs.

### Actions to Be Taken
Organizations should evaluate their current identity management practices, especially focusing on their ability to manage identities in increasingly complex IT environments. They might consider integrating platforms like Hydden to gain consolidated and continuous visibility into their identity landscape. This includes not only human identities but also service accounts, API keys, and application tokens. Regular audits to identify over-provisioned or over-privileged accounts, along with dynamic and continuous identity risk assessments, can bolster overall security. Such measures can help organizations stay ahead of potential breaches and better manage the modern complexities of IT identity.
