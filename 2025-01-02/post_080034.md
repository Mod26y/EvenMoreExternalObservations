1) In this security incident, threat actors are exploiting a vulnerability in Four-Faith routers, identified as CVE-2024-12856, which allows remote command injection after authentication. This flaw enables attackers to open reverse shells, gaining full remote access to the compromised routers. The vulnerability affects specific router models prevalent in sectors such as energy, utilities, transportation, telecommunications, and manufacturing. Despite being reported to the manufacturer, it is uncertain if patches have been released to address the issue. The attack leverages default credentials and a manipulated HTTP POST request to inject commands, reminiscent of past vulnerabilities targeting similar endpoints.

2) The exploitation of this vulnerability is significant because it compromises routers that could be crucial infrastructure components in critical industries, potentially leading to broader network security breaches. Access to these routers can allow attackers to pivot within a network, modify router configurations for persistent access, and potentially disrupt services. With 15,000 internet-facing devices at risk, the threat could impact numerous organizations globally, emphasizing the necessity for rigorous cybersecurity measures and quick mitigation of known vulnerabilities to protect sensitive sectors.

3) In response to this vulnerability, affected organizations should verify that their Four-Faith routers are updated to the latest firmware version available and ensure default credentials are replaced with strong, unique passwords. Additionally, implement the Suricata rule provided by VulnCheck to detect and block exploitation attempts in real-time. Organizations should actively contact Four-Faith representatives for guidance on specific mitigation strategies related to CVE-2024-12856. It could be beneficial to review network security policies, enhance monitoring of router activities, and educate staff about the risks of default credentials.
