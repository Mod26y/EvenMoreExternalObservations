### What Happened

The Middle East is experiencing rapid digital transformation, attracting substantial investment to places like Dubai and Riyadh. However, this growth is coupled with an increased risk of cyberattacks due to a lack of local cybersecurity talent and over-reliance on outsourcing. Cyberattacks, especially DDoS attacks, have surged by 75%, with countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia experiencing frequent incidents. The sophistication of attacks has increased with the usage of AI, making attacks more potent and hard to detect. Consequently, companies are urged to shift from outsourcing to developing internal cybersecurity capabilities.

### Why it Matters

The cybersecurity gap in the Middle East is leaving businesses critically vulnerable at a time when the region is emerging as a digital powerhouse. This vulnerability can lead to severe financial losses, estimated at over $8 million per incident, and damage to reputations. The use of AI in cyberattacks has increased the threat level, requiring more sophisticated and responsive defense mechanisms. The skills shortage exacerbates these risks and challenges business continuity. Strengthening in-house cybersecurity efforts is crucial for these businesses to safeguard their digital assets and maintain their competitive edge in the global market.

### Recommended Actions

Middle Eastern businesses should prioritize building robust internal cybersecurity defenses. Initiatives should include hiring and retaining skilled cybersecurity professionals and partnering with universities to attract graduates. Corporations can establish apprenticeship programs to develop talent internally, ensuring skills align with specific company needs. Continuous learning and development should be fostered to retain staff and keep pace with evolving cyber threats. Company-wide upskilling programs can address human error, a leading cause of breaches. By taking proactive measures to cultivate cybersecurity talent and capabilities internally, companies can mitigate risks and better protect themselves against evolving cyber threats.
