3) **What actions should be taken:** Organizations, especially those in high-risk regions or industries, should strengthen their cybersecurity measures. Reviewing and updating incident response plans can enhance readiness against potential ransomware threats. Encouraging information-sharing between public and private sectors will facilitate a more robust defense posture. Additionally, investing in employee training to recognize phishing or social engineering attacks can mitigate initial infiltration attempts. Engaging in diplomatic efforts could also address and potentially deter such state-sponsored cyber activities.
