1) Without access to the article's full text, it's challenging to detail specifics, but the title suggests that popular AI systems have unresolved security issues. This implies vulnerabilities in AI technologies that might be exploited by attackers due to inadequate security measures. These AI implementations are prevalent, potentially affecting a wide array of applications across industries, leading to widespread consequences if exploited.

2) This issue is significant as AI systems are increasingly integrated into critical infrastructure, decision-making processes, and consumer applications. Any vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches, manipulation of AI outcomes, or unauthorized access to sensitive information, resulting in financial, reputational, and regulatory ramifications.

3) Organizations should prioritize securing their AI systems by implementing stringent risk assessments and developing robust security practices. Regular security audits and updates, incorporating potential threat modeling into AI deployment strategies, and ensuring employee awareness of AI security risks can mitigate potential threats. Additionally, collaboration with AI developers for security patches and adherence to best practices can aid in fortifying AI technologies against evolving threats.
