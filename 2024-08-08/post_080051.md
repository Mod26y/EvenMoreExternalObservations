1. **What Happened**:
SafeBreach security researcher Alon Leviev revealed at Black Hat 2024 that two zero-days in the Windows operating system could allow for downgrade attacks. These attacks enable threat actors to roll back fully updated Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server systems to previous, vulnerable states. Microsoft has acknowledged the vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-38202 and CVE-2024-21302) and is working on a fix. In the meantime, the company has issued advisories offering mitigation guidance to reduce the risk of exploitation.

2. **Why It Matters**:
The revelation underscores a critical vulnerability in the Windows update process, making the term "fully patched" virtually meaningless. This downgrade attack can render systems susceptible to thousands of previously fixed vulnerabilities, severely compromising security. Most concerning is the fact that these attacks are undetectable by current endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems. For a large US County, this could mean a massive potential exposure of sensitive data, disruption of critical services, and a significant increase in security management complexity.

3. **What Actions Should Be Taken**:
The information security steering committee should immediately review and apply Microsoft's mitigation strategies detailed in their advisories. Security practices, such as enhancing user privilege controls and ensuring strict monitoring of unusual administrative behavior, can help reduce exposure. Additionally, placing a temporary hold on less critical updates may provide time for Microsoft's comprehensive fix to be deployed and tested. Continuous education of IT staff about these vulnerabilities and potential risks can further prepare the county to respond effectively if an attack occurs.
