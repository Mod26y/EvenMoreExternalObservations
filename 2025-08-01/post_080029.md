Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-to-disable-external-workbook-links-to-blocked-file-types/

1) **What happened:**
Microsoft announced a future update for Microsoft Excel, planned to occur between October 2025 and July 2026, which will disable external links to certain blocked file types by default. These changes follow an expanded File Block Settings policy which will prevent referencing unsupported file types, resulting in a #BLOCKED error when attempts are made to refresh such links. This initiative extends existing security measures to reduce risks associated with malicious content delivered through external Excel links. The update will begin notifying users of this change with Build 2509 and after Build 2510, users will be unable to refresh or create new references without policy configuration.

2) **Why it matters:**
Blocking external links to certain file types in Excel cuts off a potential vector for phishing attacks and malware distribution, targeting vulnerabilities within Microsoft's ecosystem. As Office and Windows features have historically been exploited for malicious purposes, these security enhancements are significant in protecting users from compromised files. Organizations reliant on Microsoft 365 need to be aware of such changes to prepare for potential disruptions in workflows involving external links and adapt their practices accordingly, ensuring continued productivity and compliance with security protocols.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
Organizations should immediately begin reviewing their current Excel workbooks to identify the extent of reliance on external links to these blocked file types and plan accordingly. Communicating these upcoming changes to end users will be critical to minimizing workflow interruptions. Microsoft 365 administrators might consider setting up procedures to modify the registry key if there is a persistent business need to refresh certain external links. As these features are deactivated, alternative solutions should be investigated to maintain productivity while still adhering to strengthened security guidelines. Regular training and updates on phishing attack prevention should also be conducted.
