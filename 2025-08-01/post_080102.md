1) The article reports that a Russian cyber-espionage group, Secret Blizzard, linked to the FSB, is using Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Moscow to conduct adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attacks on diplomatic missions. By redirecting embassy networks to malicious captive portals, they distribute a malware disguised as a Kaspersky antivirus installer called ApolloShadow. This malware installs a fake trusted root certificate, allowing persistent access for intelligence gathering. The campaign, possibly active since 2024, exploits Russia's domestic interception abilities for broad targeting.

2) This situation is critical as it shows the advanced tactics used by state-backed hackers to gain reliable access to sensitive diplomatic communications. By infecting systems at the ISP level, Secret Blizzard potentially undermines the security of international embassies operating in Moscow. Embassies may unknowingly aid in intelligence collection which could affect international diplomacy and security decisions. Moreover, leveraging state infrastructure highlights the intermingling of government facilities and cyber-operations, increasing the difficulty of defense measures.

3) Diplomatic missions should assess their current cybersecurity posture, focusing on securing internet connections and verifying the integrity of software updates. Implementing stringent network monitoring and traffic analysis is crucial for detecting unusual patterns indicative of AiTM activities. Diplomatic entities should employ end-to-end encryption where possible and conduct regular cybersecurity training to ensure awareness of potential threats. Collaborating with international cybersecurity bodies could also foster intelligence sharing to better identify and counteract evolving threats.
