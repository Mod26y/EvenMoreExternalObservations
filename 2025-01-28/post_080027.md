**What Happened:** Microsoft has acknowledged that the January 2025 security updates for Windows are causing audio playback issues on systems using external Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs). This primarily affects Windows 24H2, Windows 10 22H2, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2016 when using DACs that rely on USB 1.0 audio drivers. Users experiencing this problem might see a "This device cannot start. (Code 10)" error in Device Manager, indicating insufficient system resources to complete the API.

**Why It Matters:** This issue has significant implications for users relying on DACs for enhanced audio quality, impacting various sectors including home entertainment, professional audio production, and business environments. The problem disrupts sound system functionality, leading to potential downtime and loss of productivity, especially for professional users. As audio quality is important for many use cases, it may affect user experience and satisfaction, highlighting the importance of rigorous update testing procedures.

**Actions to be Taken:** Affected users can temporarily resolve the issue by connecting audio devices directly to PCs without using an external DAC. Security teams should disseminate this temporary workaround until a permanent fix is released. Monitoring Microsoft's updates for a permanent solution is crucial. Organizations should examine the compatibility of their audio systems with the latest updates before wide-scale deployment. Maintaining regular backups and having rollback plans for critical systems can mitigate similar risks in future updates.
