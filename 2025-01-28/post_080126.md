**What Happened:**
Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth, experienced one of the largest data breaches in history, affecting around 190 million individuals. Initially, the breach was reported to have impacted 100 million people, but UnitedHealth later updated this figure. This incident involved the exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, birth dates, and contact details to multiple ransomware criminals. Despite a significant ransom payment, the breach led to data exposure that touched more than half of the US population, affecting numerous participants in the healthcare sector.

**Why It Matters:**
The breach's scale underscores the critical vulnerability of major healthcare networks, given their extensive data handling spanning numerous service providers and medical entities. Such massive data breaches can lead to severe identity theft and fraud risks, particularly when sensitive PII is compromised. The delay in notifying affected individuals and updating the number of affected persons raises concerns about transparency and responsiveness in managing cybersecurity incidents. The incident highlights the importance of thorough data protection practices and timely breach notifications to mitigate potential damage to affected individuals.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**
Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity measures by implementing robust incident detection and response strategies. Regulatory bodies might consider evaluating and updating cybersecurity frameworks to ensure timely incident notification requirements are met. Regular audits of security protocols and employee training in cybersecurity best practices could mitigate similar risks in the future. Additionally, businesses should consider implementing advanced threat intelligence and monitoring systems to detect unauthorized access early, limiting potential damage from cyber incidents. Clear communication plans should be in place to swiftly inform affected parties and partners about breaches.
