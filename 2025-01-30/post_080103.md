In this incident, scammers exploited the likeness and reputation of Namibia's former first lady, Monica Geingos, to execute investment scams through manipulated online videos. These scams featured Geingos purportedly endorsing get-rich-quick schemes, especially foreign exchange trading platforms. The scam's effectiveness is attributed to Geingos' regional influence and financial acumen, as well as the increasing use of sophisticated technology like doctored video calls, making the fraudulent schemes appear more credible and exploiting victims' trust and lack of digital literacy.

This scam highlights the evolving nature of cybercrime in Africa, particularly impersonation tactics leveraging influential figures to exploit trust. Due to limited resources and international operational boundaries, African law enforcement struggles to tackle such crimes effectively. The incident underscores the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures and public awareness initiatives to mitigate the impact of such scams, which can severely affect individuals' financial security, as exemplified by victims losing their savings.

In response to this scam, it is essential to enhance public digital literacy to encourage skepticism of online interactions with public figures. Governments could accelerate the implementation and enforcement of cybersecurity legislation, as well as equip law enforcement with adequate resources for cross-border cooperation. Moreover, collaborations with international organizations like INTERPOL, alongside continued efforts from local institutions, can bolster the fight against these sophisticated scams. Public awareness campaigns highlighting common scam tactics and fostering critical evaluation of online content can help citizens shield themselves from falling prey to such scams.
