1) The incident concerns a new variant of the Mirai botnet, named Aquabotv3, exploiting a vulnerability in Mitel SIP phones (CVE-2024-41710) to conduct DDoS attacks. Researchers from Akamai discovered its potential to attain root access through a command-injection flaw. Unlike its predecessors, Aquabotv3 features a new communication capability with attacker command-and-control servers. Threat actors, advertising the botnet as DDoS-as-a-service on platforms like Telegram, have been using stolen credentials to conceal malicious activities, misleading targets about their true intentions.

2) This development is significant as it underscores the evolving threat landscape and the persistent adaptation of the Mirai botnet to exploit IoT vulnerabilities. The ease of spreading such malware across insecure IoT devices poses a growing threat, especially when leveraged for expansive DDoS attacks. The capacity of Aquabot to operate as DDoS-as-a-service amplifies the risk for targets worldwide, as it potentially empowers a broader base of cybercriminals with low technical barriers to entry, contributing to more frequent and impactful network disruptions.

3) In response, organizations should prioritize securing IoT devices by regularly updating firmware and ensuring robust configurations that avoid default credentials. Conducting comprehensive audits to identify and secure any vulnerable endpoints, particularly those running compromised Mitel devices, could mitigate the risk of exploitation. Implementing network segmentation and utilizing IoC lists, as well as Snort and Yara rules provided by Akamai, can enhance detection and response mechanisms to counteract potential botnet-related attacks before they escalate.
