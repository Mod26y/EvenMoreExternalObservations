The article discusses Aquabotv3, a new variant of the Mirai-based botnet that exploits a command injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-41710) in Mitel SIP phones. Discovered by Akamai's Security Intelligence and Response Team, Aquabotv3 reports kill attempts to its C2 server, indicating a unique monitoring feature. The botnet uses a proof-of-concept released by a security researcher to gain unauthorized access by targeting authentication processes and downloading malicious code to persist on compromised devices, thus enabling it to conduct DDoS attacks. Aquabotv3 is notable for exploiting a medium-severity flaw, affecting various sectors reliant on Mitel SIP phones.

This development is significant because it highlights evolving threats that target specific flaws in critical infrastructure devices used by a wide range of sectors, including corporate, government, and healthcare. Aquabotv3's sophistication, especially its capability to detect system kill signals, increases the effectiveness of DDoS attacks by leveraging compromised devices. The ability of Aquabotv3 to spread through multiple vulnerabilities and weak credentials amplifies its potential impact, causing service disruptions, financial loss, and compromised sensitive information across affected networks.

In response to this threat, organizations using Mitel SIP phones should prioritize applying the patches provided by Mitel to address the vulnerability. Implementing strong authentication measures and regularly updating device configurations can mitigate unauthorized access attempts. IT teams should monitor network traffic for indicators of compromise such as those listed by Akamai, and consider deploying Snort and YARA rules to detect Aquabotv3 activity. Institutions should also conduct security audits of IoT devices, ensure secure credentials are in use, and train staff on recognizing and preventing security breaches.
