Apologies for the inability to access the article, but I can provide a general overview based on the title and similar incidents. 

1) What happened: Asian organizations have begun shifting their cybersecurity requirements to their suppliers. This move likely aims to strengthen their overall security posture by ensuring that third-party vendors comply with specific security protocols. The rise in breaches has prompted organizations to recognize the vulnerabilities that can be introduced through unprotected supply chains, thus necessitating similar security standards across their network of suppliers and partners.

2) Why it matters: This practice underscores the importance of securing the entire supply chain, not just the organization's internal systems. A breach in a supplier's system can become an entry point for attackers, threatening the primary organization. By requiring suppliers to adhere to stringent cybersecurity requirements, organizations can mitigate risks associated with third-party vulnerabilities, which have been exploited in numerous high-profile attacks. This strategy emphasizes a proactive approach to cybersecurity, fostering a more resilient and secure business ecosystem.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should assess their current supply chain security policies and consider implementing more rigorous requirements. This could involve developing a comprehensive supplier security assessment framework, enhancing communication and collaboration with vendors, and providing clear guidelines for expected security practices. Additionally, continuous monitoring and regular audits of suppliers' cybersecurity measures could be beneficial. Organizations may also consider offering training and resources to help their suppliers meet these new requirements, fostering a cooperative approach to cybersecurity.
