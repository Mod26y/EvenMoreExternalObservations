1) What happened: It appears there was a technical issue obtaining the article text from Dark Reading, which resulted in a 403 Client Error due to restricted access. Despite the lack of direct access to the article content, it is inferred from the title that the article likely discusses the importance of integrating security practices into the coding process, promoting a culture of secure development akin to adopting "vibes" or ethos aligned with security-first principles.

2) Why it matters: Emphasizing security during the coding phase is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle. This proactive approach can reduce the potential attack surface and lower the costs associated with post-deployment vulnerability mitigation. It also enhances the overall security posture of an organization, safeguarding against data breaches that can lead to financial losses and reputational damage.

3) Actions to be taken: Development teams should receive training on secure coding practices and engage in regular code reviews and security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Adopting a security development lifecycle (SDL) model can integrate security checkpoints throughout the development process, ensuring any code put in production aligns with security best practices. Furthermore, fostering a collaborative environment between development and security teams can improve threat modeling and secure coding techniques.
