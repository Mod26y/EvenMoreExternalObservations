**What happened:**  
Microsoft has introduced Copilot Chat to its 365 Office suite applications like Word, Excel, and Outlook, aiming to enhance business user experiences by leveraging AI technology. Unlike the broader Microsoft 365 Copilot, the Copilot Chat version accesses only web data rather than organizational content. Available at no additional cost for specific license holders, users who choose to pay for a Microsoft 365 Copilot license can unlock broader data access, enabling Copilot Chat to analyze various work-related data. Microsoft is also planning automatic app installations outside the EEA but allows IT admins to opt out.

**Why it matters:**  
The rollout of AI-driven Copilot Chat represents a significant shift in productivity tools, underscoring a broader integration of artificial intelligence to streamline business processes. This initiative highlights evolving office software's functionality and dependency on AI, promising increased efficiency by minimizing app-switching and manual data handling. However, it also raises potential security concerns when opting for expanded data access, necessitating heightened awareness and stringent data governance by organizations using the tool to safeguard sensitive information.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations should evaluate their Microsoft 365 licensing to determine eligibility for Copilot Chat and assess the benefits of acquiring additional Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses for greater data integration. IT administrators should consider security implications and configure settings to control AI access to sensitive data appropriately. They should also prepare for the potential automatic installation by being proactive in managing app deployments. Finally, organizations should update training programs to include guidance on Copilot Chat usage while monitoring its impact on productivity and security.
