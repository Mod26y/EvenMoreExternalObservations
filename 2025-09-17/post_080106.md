Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-wmic-will-be-removed-after-windows-11-25h2-upgrade/

1) What happened: Microsoft has announced the removal of the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) tool following upgrades to Windows 11 25H2 and later. While WMIC, a tool for interacting with the Windows Management Instrumentation system via text commands, will be phased out, the Windows Management Instrumentation itself remains unaffected. IT administrators are encouraged to transition to using PowerShell, .NET libraries, or scripting languages for similar tasks. This decision follows years of WMIC's deprecation across various Windows versions.

2) Why it matters: The removal of WMIC is significant for improving system security and efficiency. WMIC has been labeled as a "living-off-the-land binary" (LOLBIN), often misused by threat actors for executing malware, removing Volume Shadow Copies, or tampering with security software. Eliminating WMIC reduces these vulnerabilities, compelling organizations to adopt more secure tools like PowerShell, which Microsoft has extensively invested in recently. The change highlights a shift towards modern and strengthened security measures, impacting how IT departments conduct administrative tasks and scripting.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should immediately begin transitioning from WMIC to PowerShell for their WMI-related tasks. IT departments should update internal documentation and training materials to reflect this shift. Administrators should familiarize themselves with PowerShell and other recommended programmatic alternatives, ensuring that scripts and automated tasks are compatible with the updated tools. Furthermore, IT security teams need to review and revise their incident response and threat modeling strategies considering the phase-out of WMIC, eliminating any dependencies on this deprecated component.
