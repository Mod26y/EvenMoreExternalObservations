The article reports on six complaints filed by "None of Your Business" (noyb), a privacy advocacy group, against TikTok, AliExpress, SHEIN, Temu, WeChat, and Xiaomi for allegedly violating the GDPR by transferring European user data to China. The complaints highlight that China lacks adequate data protection measures and processes citizen data without restrictions. Noyb has filed these complaints in various European countries, seeking action from data protection authorities to suspend data transfers and ensure compliance with GDPR standards.

These complaints matter because they underscore the significant challenges related to data sovereignty and privacy, especially concerning data transfers to countries that may not have stringent privacy protections. Such practices can potentially lead to unauthorized state access to personal information, infringing on privacy rights. Addressing these allegations is crucial for upholding GDPR principles, reinforcing trust in data protection frameworks, and ensuring that global companies adhere to international privacy standards.

In light of this information, organizations handling personal data should conduct thorough due diligence regarding international data transfers, ensuring compliance with GDPR and other relevant privacy laws. They could also enhance transparency with users about data processing practices and respond to data access requests diligently. Data protection authorities may consider conducting impact assessments and audits to evaluate compliance, while companies in violation need to review and adjust their data transfer practices to prevent potential legal and financial repercussions.
