The article highlights the release of new guidance by CISA and its international partners, aimed at owners and operators of Operational Technology (OT). This guidance titled "Secure by Demand" is part of CISA’s series to help OT stakeholders select digital products that emphasize security and encourage manufacturers focused on continuous improvement. OT systems, crucial to critical infrastructure, are at high risk of cyberattacks. This guidance addresses vulnerabilities due to poorly designed OT products by advising procurement practices that prioritize security.

This development is significant because the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyberattacks poses significant national security risks. Often, OT systems are antiquated and lack robust cybersecurity features. By emphasizing "secure by design" products, the guidance seeks to mitigate potential threats that could disrupt services or damage infrastructure. Such attacks could have widespread impacts, affecting industries from energy to water supply. This initiative suggests a shift towards preventive cybersecurity measures rather than reactive ones.

As a reaction to this guidance, OT owners and operators could benefit from reviewing their procurement processes to prioritize the guidance’s security criteria. This involves identifying and collaborating with manufacturers that demonstrate a strong commitment to cybersecurity improvements. Additionally, stakeholders could increase their awareness and understanding of secure by design principles and integrate them into their strategic planning and training programs. Engaging in industry forums or workshops based on this guidance might also help stakeholders stay updated on emerging threats and best practices.
