The article reports that MEF, a global consortium, has announced advancements in its Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) Certification Program. Leading technology and service providers, including Fortinet and AT&T, have achieved full SASE certification. This certification ensures that these providers have met rigorous standards encompassing SD-WAN, Security Service Edge (SSE), and Zero Trust (ZT) capabilities, confirming their commitment to providing secure network solutions necessary for digital transformation.

This matters because as cyber threats become more complex and frequent, organizations need reliable security solutions. SASE certification by MEF gives these organizations confidence in choosing technology and service providers whose solutions have been independently validated. This supports enterprises in protecting digital assets and advances efforts towards a secure digital transformation, which is critical in navigating the modern digital threats landscape.

Organizations should consider choosing service and technology providers with SASE certification to enhance their cybersecurity defenses. This certification can be a determining factor during the vendor selection process, ensuring solutions are in line with recognized standards. Organizations might also explore participating in industry events, like MEFâ€™s Global Network-as-a-Service Event, for insights into developments and innovations in network security, helping to further safeguard their network infrastructures.
