The National Security Memorandum (NSM) issued by President Biden highlights the crucial role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in national security and foreign policy. This memorandum underscores the intent to ensure U.S. leadership in AI development, emphasizing safe, secure, and trustworthy AI systems. It tasks various U.S. government departments with safeguarding the AI supply chain from foreign threats and improving AI capabilities for cyber threat detection and response. The NSM also seeks to align AI usage with democratic values and human rights, urging global compliance with such standards to maintain international stability.

This development matters because AI is increasingly integral to national security, both as a tool for defense and a potential target for espionage. Ensuring the secure development and deployment of AI technologies is critical, as adversaries may attempt to compromise these systems through cyber attacks or theft. Establishing comprehensive guidelines and best practices can bolster resilience against such risks, safeguarding national interests and maintaining the U.S. lead in global AI advancements. Furthermore, the memorandum encourages international cooperation and governance to address the shared risks and benefits of AI technology.

Actions recommended include establishing robust systems to monitor and protect the AI supply chain against foreign threats, and enhancing cross-agency collaboration on AI-related cybersecurity measures. The dissemination of unclassified guidance on AI cybersecurity best practices is crucial for both developers and operators. Furthermore, efforts to promote harmonized international standards and regulations will be essential in managing risks associated with AIâ€™s global proliferation. Engaging in proactive cybersecurity and counterintelligence efforts can help in maintaining technological advantages and securing AI advancements.
