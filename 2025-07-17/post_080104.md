**What happened:**  
Organizations are increasingly relying on artificial intelligence (AI) to support their cybersecurity measures. The ISC2 survey indicates that more entities are integrating AI to improve threat detection, automate response protocols, and streamline security workflow management. Although specific details from the article are not available, it is likely that AI is being adopted to manage growing cyber threats, optimize resource allocation, and enhance overall security posture.

**Why it matters:**  
The growing reliance on AI in cybersecurity is significant because it reflects a shift toward more advanced, automated defense mechanisms in managing complex and evolving cyber threats. AI can offer increased efficiency and accuracy in detecting and responding to threats at a scale that human analysts alone may struggle to achieve. However, the dependency on AI also underscores the need for robust ethical frameworks and vigilant oversight to prevent issues like algorithmic bias, false positives, and the potential for AI systems to be exploited if not properly managed and secured.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations should focus on carefully assessing the integration of AI into their cybersecurity strategies. They should conduct comprehensive evaluations of AI tools to ensure they align with their security objectives and compliance requirements. It is also important to invest in training for cybersecurity personnel to manage and interpret AI findings effectively. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of AI systems is essential to address any vulnerabilities and ensure their transparent and ethical use. Collaboration with industry peers to share insights on AI effectiveness and pitfalls can also facilitate a more secure adoption.
