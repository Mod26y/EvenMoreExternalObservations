1) What happened: A five-year-old vulnerability in GitLab, known as CVE-2021-39935, has been actively exploited in cyberattacks. This flaw allows external, unauthorized users to perform server-side requests through the CI Lint API, impacting versions from 10.5 to 14.3.6 and others within certain ranges. Though GitLab addressed this flaw in December 2021, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has mandated that federal agencies patch their systems by February 2026 due to its continued exploitation, as outlined in Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01.

2) Why it matters: The continued attacks exploiting CVE-2021-39935 highlight the persistent risks posed by outdated or unpatched software. GitLab's platform is widely used, including by major Fortune 100 companies, increasing the potential impact of successful attacks. With over 49,000 devices exposed online, including nearly 27,000 using default configurations, the vulnerability serves as a significant attack vector. This ongoing issue underscores the importance of timely patch management to protect sensitive infrastructure and data from unauthorized access and potential cyber threats.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations, especially those using GitLab, should review and update their systems to ensure all security patches for known vulnerabilities, like CVE-2021-39935, have been applied. This includes both federal agencies and private sector entities. CISA's advice to follow vendor instructions for mitigating risks or discontinuing exposure to unpatched systems should be considered seriously. Additionally, organizations can benefit from regular security audits and enhanced monitoring of exposed devices, as well as employing automated tools to manage vulnerabilities efficiently and avoid manual delays in security workflows.
