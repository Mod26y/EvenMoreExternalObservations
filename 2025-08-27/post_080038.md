1) The article reports that cyber attackers breached Salesloft to steal OAuth and refresh tokens from its Drift chat agent integration with Salesforce. This breach occurred between August 8 and August 18, 2025, allowing attackers to access customer environments and exfiltrate sensitive data like AWS access keys and passwords. Salesforce and Salesloft revoked all active tokens, requiring customers to re-authenticate. Googleâ€™s Threat Intelligence Group is tracking the threat actor as UNC6395, who utilized various methods to hide their operations while engaging in further platform breaches and data exfiltration.

2) This incident highlights significant vulnerabilities in third-party integrations, which can be exploited for unauthorized access to sensitive data. As Salesloft and Salesforce are widely used in business operations, this breach raises concerns about the broader security risks associated with cloud-based services and CRM platforms. The attack also shows how sophisticated threat actors can pivot from one platform to another, emphasizing the necessity for robust security practices and vigilance in managing integrations and access permissions.

3) Organizations should conduct a thorough security review of their integrations and access tokens, ensuring that all are up-to-date and secure. Admins may consider incrementally rotating credentials and diligently reviewing Salesforce logs for suspicious activity. It's also vital to educate employees on identifying and reporting phishing attacks, as social engineering remains a prevalent method for gaining initial access. Companies could also evaluate the necessity of each integration and reassess their security frameworks to incorporate stronger authentication and monitoring tools to detect and prevent unauthorized access.
