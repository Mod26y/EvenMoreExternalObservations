In the third quarter of 2024, India experienced a substantial surge in cyberattacks, particularly targeting API services in banking and utilities sectors, with numbers doubling from the previous year. Indusface, a cybersecurity service provider, recorded nearly 1.2 billion attacks, marking significant growth in bot and vulnerability exploits, exacerbated by the accessibility of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. The financial and energy sectors were notably affected, facing geopolitical-targeted disruptions. This uptick in incidents calls for heightened awareness and proactive risk management strategies within organizations to mitigate potential breaches and service disruptions.

The increased frequency of attacks in India, far outpacing global averages, underscores the heightened risk environment catalyzed by technological advances. The accessibility of sophisticated tools that empower even novice hackers to exploit vulnerabilities poses profound challenges for cybersecurity. The banking and utility sectors, integral to economic stability and national security, face intensified threats that could result in severe service disruptions and financial losses. These developments highlight the critical need for organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and allocate resources to protect critical infrastructure, ensuring resilience against evolving attack vectors.

In light of these findings, organizations in vulnerable sectors should intensify their cybersecurity efforts by adopting advanced threat detection and mitigation solutions. Proactive measures include deploying automated API security scanners, enhancing vulnerability management programs, and reinforcing patch management protocols to close security gaps promptly. Additionally, continuous education and training for cybersecurity personnel on emerging threats and technologies, like LLMs, would improve response strategies. Collaboration with government agencies and industry peers for intelligence sharing and incident response planning can further strengthen defenses against sophisticated cyber threats.
