The United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released a draft of the National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP). The plan is meant to guide public and private sectors in handling significant cyber incidents. It is designed to coordinate responses among various levels of government and private entities. The NCIRP defines cyber incidents, particularly those with national ramifications, and builds on a foundation of real-world experiences and legislative changes. This draft is an update to the 2016 version and reflects the substantial shifts in the cybersecurity landscape and response strategies emphasized in the 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy.

This draft plan is significant because it sets a coordinated national framework for responding to significant cyber threats, which can impact national security, the economy, and public welfare. By providing a unified and updated approach, the NCIRP aims to enhance collaboration between diverse entities, ensuring more efficient and effective management of cyber incidents. Given the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, such a coordinated response is critical in mitigating damage and bolstering resilience across sectors.

Organizations, especially those in the private sector and state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments, are encouraged to review the draft NCIRP and provide feedback during the public comment period, which ends on January 15, 2025. Engaging in this review process is essential as it allows stakeholders to understand the national response framework and potentially influence its final structure. Furthermore, stakeholders should consider aligning their internal incident response plans with the NCIRP to enhance efficiency and cooperation with federal responses in the event of significant cyber incidents.
