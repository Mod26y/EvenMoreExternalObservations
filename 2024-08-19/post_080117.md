1. **What Happened?**
   Recent cyber threats targeting the 2024 US political campaigns have surged, involving incidents such as compromised credentials via a Telegram bot and malicious phishing emails sent by Iran-backed groups using hacked accounts. Noteworthy is a candidate’s false AI-related accusation against an opponent. These incidents exemplify the multifaceted nature of campaign vulnerabilities, underscoring the persistence of nation-state actors and sophisticated cyberattacks during election cycles.

2. **Why It Matters?**
   The increase in cyber threats to political campaigns highlights significant security risks to the integrity of the democratic process. With the potential to disrupt elections through misinformation, credential theft, and phishing attacks, such threats can undermine public trust and affect election outcomes. The timing of these attacks, especially close to Election Day, can be particularly detrimental, influencing voter perceptions and turnout.

3. **What Actions Should Be Taken?**
   Campaigns should prioritize cybersecurity by leveraging readily available tools and services such as CloudFlare and Google’s Project Shield. Implementing strong cyber hygiene practices, including limiting and regularly updating account credentials, is crucial. Increasing reliance on hardware tokens can further enhance security. Campaigns should also take advantage of services provided by organizations like Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC) and maintain continuous awareness of evolving threats and best practices in cybersecurity.
