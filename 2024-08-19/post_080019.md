### 1. What happened:

Microsoft has released Windows 11 Build 27686 as part of a preview update, which includes several notable enhancements such as 2TB support for FAT32 storage, improvements to Windows Sandbox, and better control over HDR settings. A particularly important but undocumented change is the ability to set different power modes for when a PC is plugged in and when it’s running on battery. Previously, users could only apply one uniform power mode regardless of the power state, but now they can customize settings to prioritize performance or battery life based on whether the device is plugged in or not.

### 2. Why it matters:

This update is significant because it gives users finer control over their device’s power consumption, directly impacting both performance and battery life management. By allowing separate power modes for different power states, users can optimize their experience; for example, they can select a high-performance mode when the device is plugged in and a power-saving mode when on battery. This change not only enhances user convenience but can also prolong battery lifespan and improve overall device efficiency. It’s a noteworthy improvement in user experience and device management, which could lead to broader adoption of Windows 11.

### 3. What actions should be taken as a result of this information:

Users and IT administrators should explore and familiarize themselves with these new power mode settings to optimize device performance and battery life based on usage. Training or internal documentation might be helpful to ensure efficient use of these features. Enterprises should consider updating their power management policies and device settings to align with these new capabilities, potentially incorporating automated profiles for different user scenarios. Additionally, organizations should monitor these changes for any unintended effects on system performance or battery health, adjusting configurations as necessary for optimal performance and energy efficiency.
