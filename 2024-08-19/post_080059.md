### What Happened?
Microsoft 365 customers are experiencing crashes with classic Outlook immediately upon opening or when starting in Safe Mode, attributed to corrupted mailbox client and server rules linked to Microsoft 365 email accounts. Users can confirm they are affected by checking for Event 1000 or Event 1001 crashes in the Windows Event Viewer Application Log associated with the 0xc0000005 exception code related to the ucrtbase.dll module. Temporary workarounds involve manually deleting all email rules by running the 'Outlook.exe /cleanrules' command and potentially creating a new Outlook profile.

### Why It Matters
This issue is highly disruptive, particularly for businesses and organizations heavily reliant on Outlook for daily communications and scheduling. The frequent crashes can lead to significant downtime, hampering productivity and potentially causing financial and reputational damage. Additionally, issues that cannot be resolved by standard troubleshooting methods like reverting to previous builds, creating new profiles, or performing Windows clean installs highlight deeper systemic problems that may require urgent attention to mitigate potential wider security vulnerabilities.

### Actions to Take
Organizations should follow Microsoft's temporary workaround by running the 'Outlook.exe /cleanrules' command to delete corrupted email rules and, if necessary, create new Outlook profiles cautiously. IT departments should stay informed of any further updates or official fixes released by Microsoft to address the issue permanently. It is advisable to communicate with users about the issue and provide guidance on the workaround steps. Moreover, organizations should review their regular update and backup procedures to expedite recovery and minimize disruption in case of similar issues in the future.
