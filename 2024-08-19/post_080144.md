**What happened:**  
CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the FBI released a joint public service announcement assuring American voters that the integrity of the electoral process remains secure despite potential ransomware disruptions. Previous elections saw attempts by malicious actors to undermine public confidence and manipulate opinion through false information. Although there have been localized ransomware attacks, these incidents have had minimal operational disruption and no impact on ballot accuracy. CISA and the FBI highlight the use of multilayered defenses combining technology, physical security, and procedural controls to prevent significant cyber intrusions during elections.

**Why it matters:**  
The security of elections is fundamental to maintaining public trust in democratic processes. Assurances from authoritative bodies like CISA and the FBI reinforce voter confidence, countering efforts by malicious actors to manipulate public opinion and disrupt the electoral process. Highlighting successful measures and multilayered defenses reassures the public and underscores the importance of continual cyber vigilance. Understanding the minimal impact of past localized attacks emphasizes resilience in election security infrastructure, which is critical for national stability and public engagement in democratic processes.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**  
Election officials and IT personnel should review and strengthen their multilayered defenses against possible cyber threats. Public awareness programs should be conducted to educate voters about the improbability of ransomware affecting electoral integrity, ensuring informed and confident participation. Continuously updating and testing incident response plans can help mitigate any localized disruptions swiftly. Collaboration with national cybersecurity entities like CISA and the FBI can provide valuable resources and support. Information about mitigating ransomware impact should be distributed, and ongoing training should be provided to reinforce robust security practices.
