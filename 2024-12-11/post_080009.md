**1) What happened?**

In 2023, the Salt Typhoon, a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group, managed to breach several U.S. telecommunications companies, including major providers like T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. These cyber intrusions, which may have lasted months, enabled the hackers to access and potentially steal extensive internet traffic. This prompted U.S. Senator Ron Wyden to propose the "Secure American Communications Act," a bill aimed at enhancing the cybersecurity protocols of American telecoms and mandating annual audits and independent security testing to prevent similar breaches in the future.

**2) Why it matters?**

These breaches have severe implications for national security and the privacy of American citizens. By potentially gaining access to calls, messages, and phone records, the hackers are in a position to intercept sensitive communications and critical data. This situation highlights the inadequacy of current telecom cybersecurity policies and the significant risks posed to both businesses and the general public. Senator Wyden's proposed bill and the FCC's urgent action underline the need for a robust legislative and regulatory framework to safeguard the nation's communications infrastructure against foreign cyber threats.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

The telecom industry should conduct comprehensive security assessments to identify existing vulnerabilities, promptly addressing any discovered weaknesses. Telecommunications providers could adopt strict adherence to the upcoming cybersecurity regulations once enacted, including performing annual security audits and employing independent auditors to ensure compliance. Infrastructure administrators might also consider implementing strategies like using encrypted messaging to enhance communication privacy. The cooperation between telecoms, government agencies, and external cybersecurity experts will be essential in fortifying network defenses against sophisticated state-sponsored threats like Salt Typhoon.
