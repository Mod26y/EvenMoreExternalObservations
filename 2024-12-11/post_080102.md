The article highlights the growing threat of deepfake technology to Scottish Parliament TV, which offers unrestricted access to livestreams and recordings of parliamentary sessions. Researchers warn that attackers could manipulate live streams, create deceptive deepfake videos, or use archived content to train AI, potentially undermining public trust in democratic processes. The lack of cybersecurity measures makes these risks particularly pressing, emphasizing the need for preemptive action to safeguard the authenticity of parliamentary broadcasts.

The issue is critical because deepfakes pose a substantial threat to the integrity and trustworthiness of public communications. If attackers successfully manipulate parliamentary content, it could lead to the dissemination of false information, eroding public trust not only in the Scottish Parliament but in democracy itself. This could have broader implications for any legislative body offering similar public access, highlighting a global cybersecurity concern that could undermine governmental transparency and accountability.

In response, the Scottish Parliament could enhance their cybersecurity posture by implementing recommended measures. These include establishing intervention and reporting protocols to quickly identify and address attacks, enhancing authentication processes to secure live streams, and forming a collaborative team between their communications and broadcasting units to respond to threats. Raising awareness among parliament members and the public about the deepfake threat can further bolster protective efforts, ensuring continued trust in parliamentary proceedings.
