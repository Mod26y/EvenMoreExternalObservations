**What happened:** A critical vulnerability identified as CVE-2024-11205 was discovered in the WPForms WordPress plugin, impacting sites using versions 1.8.4 to 1.9.2.1. The flaw permits any authenticated user, including subscriber-level users, to issue unauthorized Stripe refunds or cancel subscriptions, causing detrimental financial impacts. This vulnerability arises due to insufficient capability checks in determining admin AJAX requests, thereby allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functions. A security patch was released in version 1.9.2.2 to address the issue.

**Why it matters:** This vulnerability is significant because it affects millions of WordPress websites using WPForms, creating a potential for widespread financial repercussions and loss of business credibility. Since WPForms is widely used for managing payments through platforms like Stripe, unauthorized refunds or cancellations could disrupt business operations, erode customer trust, and result in financial losses. Despite the fix, the high prevalence of outdated versions means that many websites remain vulnerable, highlighting the importance of timely updates in cybersecurity practices.

**What actions should be taken:** Website administrators should upgrade WPForms to version 1.9.2.2 immediately to benefit from the patched security flaw. For those unable to update immediately, consider temporarily disabling the plugin to mitigate risks. Regularly review and update all plugins to their latest secure versions. Implement additional security measures such as stricter access control and monitoring tools to detect unauthorized activities. Educate user roles about potential risks and establish a routine for continuous vulnerability assessments and software updates.
