1) **What happened:** According to the title, Tenable, a security firm, is addressing issues related to AI governance, shadow AI risks, and data exposure. Although specific article details are unavailable, these focus areas suggest Tenable is working on solutions to govern AI systems securely, mitigate risks associated with unauthorized or unmonitored AI (shadow AI), and protect sensitive data that AI systems may handle or expose unintentionally.

2) **Why it matters:** As AI technology advances, ensuring robust AI governance is critical to maintaining security and ethical standards. Shadow AI poses significant risks since it may operate outside visibility, leading to potential breaches or compliance issues. Furthermore, AI systems often process massive datasets, which increases the risk of data exposure, necessitating stringent protective measures to prevent data leaks and maintain privacy standards.

3) **Actions to be taken:** Organizations should review and implement comprehensive AI governance frameworks to regulate AI use. Identifying and managing shadow AI involves regularly auditing AI systems and ensuring they are cataloged and monitored. Enhancing data protection involves deploying advanced monitoring systems to detect data exposure risks and implementing data encryption and access controls. It would be advisable for organizations to stay informed on evolving AI-related security developments and integrate AI-specific policies into their broader cybersecurity strategy.
