The Indian government has drafted new rules to enforce its Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, establishing a clear framework for data privacy compliance in India. These rules aim to operationalize the protections and obligations contained in the 2021 Act, such as user rights to data access, correction, and erasure, alongside obligations for data processors to secure and responsibly manage user data. After a long history, marked by the evolution from the 2019 Personal Data Protection Bill to the more balanced DPDP, India is now setting a structured path towards robust data privacy regulation.

This development is significant because it demonstrates India's commitment to data privacy at a time of increasing digital transformation. The stringent rules, with penalties up to INR 200 crore for compliance failures, create a framework to prevent misuse and ensure greater data protection for Indian citizens. It also signals India's prioritization of citizen welfare in the digital era and sets a precedent for other nations to follow suit in establishing comprehensive data protection laws.

Organizations operating in India or handling Indian citizens' data should stay informed on the finalized rules and the compliance timeline. They should assess and possibly overhaul their data processing practices to align with the new requirements, such as ensuring data encryption and respecting users' data control rights. Engaging with legal and cybersecurity experts will be crucial to navigate the specifics of these rules and maintain compliance, particularly given the substantial penalties associated with non-compliance. Encouraging feedback prior to the deadline, February 18, ensures businesses can express their concerns and influence the final rules.
