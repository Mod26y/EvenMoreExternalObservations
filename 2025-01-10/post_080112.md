**What happened:** The article discusses the emerging challenges in the cybersecurity field, driven by AI advancements. By 2025, CISOs must prepare for increasing cybersecurity threats due to AI-enabled products and proprietary large language models (LLMs). New vulnerabilities in these AI models may lead to widespread security incidents. Additionally, the rise of cloud-native and AI applications will require more adaptive identity management systems. The evolving regulatory landscape will necessitate collaboration between security and legal teams, emphasizing compliance alongside novel security challenges.

**Why it matters:** These developments are significant as they present new security challenges that could affect numerous industries. The potential vulnerabilities in AI models could lead to widespread disruptions if exploited, impacting software integrity and user trust. Furthermore, the transition to more transient and adaptive identity management reflects the dynamic nature of modern cyber environments. The convergence of regulatory requirements and technological advancements necessitates a strategic approach to compliance and risk mitigation. AIâ€™s role in DevOps highlights its potential to enhance security measures and collaboration while addressing skill shortages.

**Actions to be taken:** CISOs should assess their exposure to AI-related threats and adopt proactive measures to mitigate them. Strengthening collaboration with legal teams is vital to ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate risks in response to evolving cybersecurity laws. Investing in adaptive identity management solutions will be crucial to accommodate the shift towards AI and cloud-native applications. Security teams should leverage AI to automate routine tasks, identify vulnerabilities, and ensure real-time responses to threats. Building AI expertise within DevOps teams can facilitate early identification of security issues, enhance automation, and close skill gaps for improved security outcomes.
