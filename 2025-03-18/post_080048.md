In this supply chain attack, an attacker added malicious code to the 'tj-actions/changed-files', affecting over 23,000 GitHub repositories. The attack involved modifying the action's code to expose CI/CD secrets during GitHub Actions workflows. An attacker compromised a GitHub personal access token, allowing the addition of the malicious commit. Once compromised, workflow logs—if publicly accessible—could display these secrets, posing risks to affected projects until the malicious code was identified and removed by GitHub.

This incident highlights the serious risks posed by supply chain attacks, particularly when widely-used automation tools are involved. Exposure of CI/CD secrets can lead to further exploitation or unauthorized access, potentially allowing attackers to compromise other parts of the infrastructure or gain insights into sensitive data. This incident emphasizes the need for comprehensive security controls and monitoring within CI/CD pipelines to prevent similar vulnerabilities from being exploited.

In response to the attack, affected users should urgently rotate any exposed secrets and conduct thorough reviews of their workflow outputs to spot anomalies. Updating workflow configurations to avoid referencing malicious commits and using tagged, verified versions is crucial. Additionally, pinning all GitHub Actions to specific commit hashes and implementing GitHub's allow-listing functionality for trusted Actions would help mitigate future risks. Emphasizing security best practices when managing automation tools can significantly reduce vulnerabilities to supply chain attacks.
