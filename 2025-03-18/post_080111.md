1) Lexmark, a global printer and managed print services company, announced the expansion of its print security services worldwide. This move likely involves enhancing the security features of its printing devices and services to support their clients better in safeguarding sensitive information. As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, businesses and public entities increasingly recognize the importance of securing endpoints, including printers, which are often overlooked as potential vectors for cyberattacks.

2) The expansion of Lexmark's print security services matters because it addresses a crucial but often underestimated component of organizational cybersecurityâ€”printer security. Printers can serve as entry points for cybercriminals who exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to networked systems, leading to data breaches and other security incidents. By enhancing security measures in print services, organizations can better protect themselves from potential threats that originate from seemingly innocuous office equipment, promoting a holistic approach to cybersecurity.

3) Organizations should consider evaluating their current print infrastructure to understand potential vulnerabilities and assess if their security posture requires enhancement. Investing in managed print services with advanced security features can be a strategic move to bolster overall security, particularly for entities managing sensitive or regulated data. Additionally, regular awareness training for employees about the importance of endpoint security, including printers, can help mitigate risks. Continuous monitoring and updating of print security measures will ensure that new threats are adequately addressed.
