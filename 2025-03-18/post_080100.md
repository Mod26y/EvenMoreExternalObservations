**What happened:** The article likely addresses attacks exploiting OAuth, an open standard for access delegation commonly used to grant websites or applications limited access to user information on platforms like Microsoft 365 and GitHub. Attackers may leverage OAuth tokens to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, bypassing traditional authentication methods. By targeting these platforms, attackers can potentially access sensitive corporate data, inject malicious code, or further propagate attacks within organizations.

**Why it matters:** OAuth attacks are significant due to their potential to bypass traditional security measures, exploiting the trust users place in well-established platforms. Successful attacks can lead to unauthorized data access, credential theft, and broader security vulnerabilities within affected organizations. As both Microsoft 365 and GitHub are integral to business operations worldwide, attacks of this nature threaten operational continuity, data integrity, and organizational reputations, highlighting the need for robust security measures around OAuth implementations.

**Actions to be taken:** Organizations should review and enhance their OAuth application permissions management, ensuring tokens are used securely and sparingly. It would be prudent to monitor for unusual OAuth activity and audit third-party applications integrated with platforms like Microsoft 365 and GitHub. Also, educating users about the risks associated with granting extensive permissions to applications increases awareness and can help mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and regularly updating security protocols will further strengthen defenses against such attacks.
