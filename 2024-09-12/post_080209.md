1) **What Happened:**
Gartner recently labeled Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) as "obsolete before plateau," causing industry controversy. This label implies SOAR technologies have not matured as standalone products and are increasingly being integrated into broader security solutions. The shift is driven by enhancements in automation and integration features within other security platforms like XDR and SIEM. Mergers and acquisitions also illustrate the consolidation trend, where companies incorporate SOAR functionalities rather than offering them as separate products. Key industry figures argue that while standalone SOAR products may face challenges, automation within cybersecurity remains crucial.

2) **Why It Matters:**
The designation of SOAR as "obsolete" highlights a significant shift in how security automation is perceived and implemented. While standalone SOAR solutions may be declining, the essential functions they perform—such as threat detection, incident response, and automation—are becoming integral to other comprehensive security platforms. This evolution underscores that cybersecurity products must continuously adapt to offer integrated, automated, and efficient solutions, reflecting industry demand for simpler and more cohesive security operations. Organizations need to understand this trend to make informed decisions about their security architecture and resource allocation.

3) **What Actions Should Be Taken:**
Organizations should re-evaluate their current security infrastructures to better integrate automation and orchestration features into their existing platforms, such as XDR or SIEM systems. This includes leveraging AI and machine learning capabilities to enhance threat detection and response efficiency. It's essential to prioritize solutions that offer seamless integration, require minimal training, and reduce operational complexity. Continuous updates and training for incident response teams to utilize advanced automation effectively will be crucial. Additionally, companies should remain informed about market trends and emerging technologies to ensure their security posture remains robust and adaptable.
