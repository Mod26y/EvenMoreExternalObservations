Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wordpressorg-to-require-2fa-for-plugin-developers-by-october/

1) What Happened:

WordPress.org will mandate two-factor authentication (2FA) for plugin and theme developers starting October 1st. This measure aims to enhance security by mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, which could lead to supply-chain attacks. This means that every account with the capability to push updates and changes to plugins and themes will have to enable 2FA. Additionally, WordPress.org has introduced SVN-specific passwords to isolate code change access from main account credentials, requiring developers to update their deployment scripts accordingly.

2) Why It Matters:

The significance of this development lies in the massive ecosystem of WordPress, which powers millions of websites globally. Plugin and theme developers hold the keys to widespread functionalities used by countless sites, making them prime targets for malicious actors. Unauthorized access to these accounts could introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors into plugins and themes, potentially compromising millions of websites. Therefore, the enforcement of 2FA coupled with SVN-specific passwords significantly augments security measures, ensuring that the integrity and trustworthiness of the WordPress ecosystem are maintained.

3) What Actions Should Be Taken:

Organizations relying on WordPress should ensure that their developers and administrators are aware of this new requirement and prepared to activate 2FA by October 1st. They should also familiarize themselves with the steps to enable 2FA and SVN-specific passwords as provided by WordPress.org. Additionally, it might be prudent to review and update their deployment scripts to accommodate the new SVN-specific password system. By proactively adapting to these changes, organizations can help ensure the continued security and reliability of their WordPress installations.
