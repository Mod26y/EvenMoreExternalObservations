**What happened?**

The generative infrastructure from code company, appCD, closed a $12.3 million seed funding round and rebranded as StackGen. The funding round was led by Thomvest Ventures and saw participation from existing investors like FireBolt Ventures, WestWave Capital, and Secure Octane. The rebranding aligns with their vision of revolutionizing infrastructure from code, emphasizing the use of generative AI to enhance developer experiences and enforce industry standards. They have also appointed Arshad Sayyad as Chief Business Officer and expanded their leadership team to bolster their go-to-market strategy and overall growth.

**Why it matters?**

The rebranding of appCD to StackGen and the $12.3 million seed funding is significant for several reasons. It indicates a maturation and strategic evolution in the companyâ€™s approach to providing infrastructure solutions, leveraging generative AI to automate and standardize infrastructure code. This development promises increased productivity for DevOps and SecOps teams by minimizing infrastructure bottlenecks and aligning infrastructure changes with application code changes seamlessly. For the cybersecurity community in particular, it means that StackGen's solutions could offer more secure, compliant, and resilient infrastructure deployments, reducing human error and enhancing overall security posture.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Organizations should closely monitor StackGen's advancements and consider evaluating its Infrastructure from Code (IfC) solutions to understand potential benefits in automation, compliance, and security. Including StackGen in a comparative review of infrastructure management tools could reveal opportunities to enhance operational efficiency and reduce security risks associated with manual infrastructure code management. Additionally, collaborating with StackGen or similar vendors could be beneficial for large-scale digital transformation initiatives, significantly improving agility and governance within cloud environments. Engaging in pilot projects or proof of concepts may provide insights into the practical benefits and integration requirements of StackGen's technology.
