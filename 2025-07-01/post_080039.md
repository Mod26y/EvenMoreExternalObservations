**What happened:** Microsoft announced that its Defender for Office 365 email security suite will now automatically detect and block email bombing attacks. Email bombing involves overwhelming a target's inbox with massive volumes of messages, which can obscure important emails and disrupt email systems. The feature, which began rolling out in June 2025, will automatically detect and classify these attacks without needing manual configuration, marking suspicious messages as Junk. This enables security teams to maintain visibility into genuine threats by preventing malicious actors from using email bombing to facilitate subsequent attacks, such as deploying ransomware.

**Why it matters:** Email bombing is a tactic used by cybercriminals to obscure significant communications, potentially leading to system overloads and opening pathways for more dangerous exploits like ransomware. This development in email protection is crucial, given that such tactics are used by notorious groups like BlackBasta and FIN7 to execute complex social engineering schemes, often leading to substantial breaches. By automating the detection and blocking of these attacks, Microsoft helps protect organizations against substantial risks, enhancing the resilience of their cybersecurity posture.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations should ensure their Microsoft Defender for Office 365 settings are up-to-date and leverage the new email bombing detection feature. Security teams need to regularly review notifications and updates from Microsoft's security suite to stay informed about new threats and preventative measures. Staff should be trained to recognize and report suspicious activities, such as a sudden influx of emails or fraudulent IT support calls. Develop robust incident response plans to address potential breaches and regularly update them to adapt to new threat landscapes.
