1) What happened: Nokia experienced a security incident involving the leak of source code from a third-party vendor. A hacker named IntelBroker managed to breach the third party via a vulnerable SonarQube server, gaining access to sensitive data such as SSH keys and BitBucket logins. Though initially attempting to sell the data, the hacker leaked it publicly after Nokia denied any direct breach. Nokia's investigation confirmed the breach affected the third-party app source code and ensured that neither its systems nor customer data were compromised.

2) Why it matters: Though Nokia's systems and data remain secure, this incident underscores the significant vulnerabilities in third-party networks and the broader supply chain. It demonstrates the potential risks companies face when relying on external vendors for software development and how unauthorized access through third-party weaknesses can indirectly threaten major corporations. This scenario also highlights the importance of robust security protocols for third-party vendors to protect sensitive and proprietary information critical to large organizations.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should closely scrutinize and continually audit the security measures of their third-party vendors, ensuring strict compliance with cybersecurity standards. Implementing robust contractual obligations for security, employing regular security assessments, and leveraging zero-trust security models can mitigate such risks. Additionally, maintaining vigilant monitoring systems and an incident response plan can help organizations quickly identify and address potential breaches in the supply chain, minimizing potential impact and ensuring business continuity.
