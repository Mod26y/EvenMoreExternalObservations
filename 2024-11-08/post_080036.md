Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) discovered critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in their Aruba Networking Access Points, specifically within the Instant AOS-8 and AOS-10 software. These vulnerabilities, identified as CVE-2024-42509 and CVE-2024-47460, could allow remote attackers to execute malicious command injections without authentication via the PAPI protocol using UDP port 8211. The severity of these flaws, with scores of 9.8 and 9.0, underscore the potential security risks to devices running affected software versions.

This issue is significant because it highlights a critical security weakness in widely used networking hardware, posing risks for unauthorized access and potential control over affected systems. While currently no active exploitation has been reported, the high severity scores imply considerable potential for damage if leveraged by malicious actors. It underscores the pervasive threat of remote attacks on network access points, which are integral to business operations.

Organizations using affected Aruba Access Points should prioritize updating to the recommended software versions provided by HPE to mitigate the vulnerabilities. Where immediate updates are impractical, implementing workarounds such as restricting access to UDP port 8211 and isolating management interfaces via dedicated network segments or VLANs can be effective interim measures. This proactive approach helps in mitigating risk and protecting network resources from potential exploitation.
