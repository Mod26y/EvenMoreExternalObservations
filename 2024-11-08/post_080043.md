### What happened

According to TeamViewer's new AI Opportunity Report, there is a significant shift among U.S. business leaders towards demanding tangible, practical implementations of AI. The report highlights an increased adoption rate, with AI usage among key decision makers rising from 60% to 81% over a year. Many leaders see AI as essential for financial outcomes and revenue growth, with new AI solutions like TeamViewer’s Session Insights enhancing IT efficiencies. This reflects a broader trend of businesses utilizing AI for operational benefits, moving past the hype to focus on real-world applications that benefit organizational productivity and decision-making.

### Why it matters

This shift highlights the growing importance of AI in strategic business execution, pointing to the need for practical and secure AI solutions. With 72% of leaders seeing AI as crucial for financial improvements, businesses that lag behind in AI adoption risk losing competitive advantages. Concerns over security and data management are also prominent, with a significant portion of leaders worried about data security and AI's uncontrolled use. These factors underscore the importance of balancing AI integration with effective security measures, suggesting that successful AI deployment is increasingly seen as vital for operational efficiency and maintaining competitive parity.

### What actions should be taken

Organizations should focus on incrementally adopting AI while maintaining stringent data privacy and security practices. This involves providing proper AI training to employees, particularly IT staff, to leverage AI tools effectively and securely. It's also important to actively monitor AI implementations, ensuring they align with company goals without compromising security. Building trust in AI’s decision-making capabilities can be supported by maintaining transparency in AI operations. Furthermore, developing comprehensive guidelines for AI use—highlighting the dos and don’ts—can also help alleviate security concerns, thereby fostering a robust AI culture within the organization.
