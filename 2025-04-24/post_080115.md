1) What happened: Ransomware gangs have adopted new affiliate models, allowing them to extend their operations by recruiting affiliates who carry out attacks in exchange for a share of the profits. These models enable ransomware groups to increase their attack frequency and efficiency by leveraging the skills and access of local cybercriminals. This innovation in their operational structure makes it more challenging for organizations to predict and defend against attacks, as they now face a larger pool of potential attackers with varied methods.

2) Why it matters: The evolution of ransomware affiliate models poses a heightened threat to all organizations, including public sector entities like county governments. With these new models, ransomware gangs can rapidly scale their operations and launch more frequent and sophisticated attacks, potentially overwhelming traditional cybersecurity defenses. Additionally, the involvement of local affiliates can lead to more targeted and damaging attacks on specific organizations or sectors, increasing the risk of significant operational disruptions and financial losses.

3) What actions should be taken: County information security teams should enhance their cybersecurity posture by adopting a multi-layered defense strategy. This includes implementing advanced threat detection and response systems, conducting regular employee training on recognizing and responding to phishing and social engineering tactics, and ensuring robust disaster recovery plans to mitigate the impact of potential ransomware attacks. Additionally, collaborating with law enforcement and sharing threat intelligence with other local agencies can support a coordinated response to emerging ransomware threats.
