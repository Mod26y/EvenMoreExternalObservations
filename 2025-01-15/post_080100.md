China has significantly increased cyberattacks against Taiwan, doubling from 1.2 million daily attempts in 2023 to 2.4 million in 2024. These attacks, primarily targeting government, telecommunications, and transportation sectors, utilized phishing emails and zero-day exploits. The surge in attacks has been linked to geopolitical tensions and reflects China's broader pattern of cyber-aggression across the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. This situation underscores the persistent and evolving nature of cyber threats faced by states and highlights Taiwan’s vulnerability to state-backed cyber operations that could compromise critical infrastructure and national security.

This issue matters because it exemplifies the growing geopolitical tensions in cyberspace where nation-state actors like China exploit digital vulnerabilities for strategic advantage. The targeting of communications infrastructure is particularly concerning as it risks the confidentiality and integrity of not just state communications but also private enterprise data, which could have broader implications for global cybersecurity stability and international relations. Other countries, including the US, face similar threats, highlighting a pressing need to focus on collective cyber-defense strategies.

In response, organizations should enhance their cybersecurity posture by deploying advanced threat detection mechanisms, such as the deceptive technologies suggested by experts like Armis’ Michael Freeman. These technologies, by introducing false targets within networks, can help detect and slow down intrusions. Organizations should also strengthen international collaborations on cybersecurity to share intelligence and develop coordinated responses against state-backed cyber threats. Emphasizing proactive measures, such as regular vulnerability assessments and staff training on identifying phishing attempts, can further bolster defense mechanisms against such high-profile attacks.
