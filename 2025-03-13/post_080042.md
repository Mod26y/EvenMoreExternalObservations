**What happened:**  
Mozilla has alerted Firefox users about the impending expiration of one of its root certificates on March 14, 2025. This certificate is vital for confirming the authenticity of add-ons and ensuring security protocols within Firefox. Users of Firefox versions older than 128 or ESR 115 may face disruptions, including the inability to use add-ons and encountering security risks. The issue affects Firefox on all platforms but iOS, which manages root certificates independently. Mozilla urges users to update to avoid significant security threats and ensure smooth browser functionality.

**Why it matters:**  
This situation underscores the critical importance of keeping software updated to maintain security and functionality. Expired root certificates can expose users to a host of vulnerabilities, including malicious add-ons and unsafe browsing experiences. Such security lapses can lead to compromised data privacy, increased exposure to phishing sites, and inefficient browser performance. For organizations, outdated software can serve as an entry point for cyber threats, posing substantial risks to sensitive data and operational integrity.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations and individual users should immediately verify their Firefox version and update to version 128 or later, or ESR 115.13 or later for ESR users. This step will help safeguard against potential security vulnerabilities and add-on disruptions. It's also essential for IT departments to ensure that their managed systems, including all desktop and mobile platforms except iOS, are compliant with the latest version requirements. Continuous education on the importance of software updates and regular checks for potential security patches should be embedded in organizational cybersecurity practices.
