1) **What happened**: The article title suggests a focus on the risks associated with "agentic AI" and the concept of "toxic flows." Though the article content is unavailable due to a 403 error, the title implies an examination of how autonomous AI systems, possibly those acting with some level of independence, might introduce vulnerabilities through their interactions (toxic flows), such as data leakage or biases.

2) **Why it matters**: Understanding the potential risks of agentic AI is crucial as these systems become more prevalent. If unmanaged, they can inadvertently compromise sensitive data, amplify biases, or disrupt critical operations. Toxic flows could lead to internal and external security breaches, eroding trust and causing significant financial and reputational damage.

3) **Actions to be taken**: Organizations should conduct thorough risk assessments to understand how agentic AI is integrated into their systems. Implementing strict access controls, constant monitoring for anomalies, and establishing protocols to evaluate AI decisions and interactions can help mitigate these risks. Providing ongoing training for staff on AI-related security risks will further enhance preparedness and response capabilities.
