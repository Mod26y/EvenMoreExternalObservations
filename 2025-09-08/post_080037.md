The National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NUKIB) of the Czech Republic advises critical infrastructure organizations to avoid Chinese technology and data transfer to Chinese servers. This precaution follows a re-evaluation that now classifies the risk of significant disruptions from China as “High.” NUKIB’s recommendation stems from evidence of Chinese cyber activities targeting Czech entities, including a recent attack. The advisory also extends to consumer devices that could transfer sensitive data to Chinese infrastructure, urging all relevant organizations to consider these threats in their risk analyses.

The warning by NUKIB emphasizes the criticality of secure technology infrastructure. Given the central role of technology providers in safeguarding data and ensuring operational integrity, any mistrust or vulnerability in these systems can severely compromise critical infrastructure. Additionally, the potential for data access by the Chinese government underscores the importance of enhanced national data sovereignty and security controls to mitigate exposure to international cyber threats.

Organizations should conduct a thorough risk assessment incorporating NUKIB's advisory into their cybersecurity strategies. They could identify and mitigate potential security gaps by auditing their technology supply chains and data-sharing arrangements. Consideration of alternative, more secure technology providers may also reduce reliance on potentially risky systems. Stakeholders in critical infrastructure sectors might invest in heightened security measures, such as encryption and network monitoring, to detect and prevent unauthorized data access or cyber intrusions.
