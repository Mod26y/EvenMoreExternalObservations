**1) What happened:** OpenAI is developing a new "Record" feature for ChatGPT that will allow users to record, transcribe, and summarize live meetings. This feature will enable functionalities such as pausing, resuming, or converting audio into text during meetings. The code for the mobile app indicates the ability to drag to talk, create detailed reports, and quickly generate summaries. Users will need to provide microphone and system audio access, and OpenAI advises obtaining consent before recording. This aims at challenging Microsoft's Teams Copilot without direct app integration.

**2) Why it matters:** The introduction of this feature indicates a significant shift towards AI-driven productivity tools, emphasizing the growing role of artificial intelligence in workplace efficiency. This also raises potential privacy concerns, as recording meetings necessitates obtaining consent and ensuring data protection. For organizations, this implies a change in how meetings are documented and highlights the importance of transparency in data processing. It also indicates increasing competition in the AI meeting assistant space, potentially leading to innovation and enhanced services.

**3) What actions should be taken:** Organizations should prepare by updating their information security policies to address the recording and storage of meeting data. It is important to educate employees on acquiring and documenting consent and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. Additionally, they should consider evaluating how this tool aligns with their current systems and security protocols to manage access rights effectively. Finally, it's essential to monitor the development of such technologies and adapt security measures accordingly, prioritizing both convenience and privacy.
