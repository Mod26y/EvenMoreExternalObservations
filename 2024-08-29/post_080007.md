1) **What happened:**
The South Korea-aligned cyberespionage group APT-C-60 has exploited a zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-7262, in WPS Office to install the SpyGlace backdoor on East Asian systems. WPS Office, a widely-used productivity suite, was targeted through a flaw in its custom protocol handlers, allowing arbitrary code execution via specially crafted URLs hidden in MHTML files. Although a patch was quietly released by Kingsoft in March 2024, a second severe flaw (CVE-2024-7263) emerged due to incomplete fixes, which was subsequently patched in May 2024.

2) **Why it matters:**
This incident highlights significant vulnerabilities in widely-used software, with over 500 million active users globally, presenting an enormous attack surface. The stealthy nature of the attack and the delayed disclosure of the flaw create significant risks, emphasizing the speed at which threat actors can leverage unpatched software. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows attackers to deploy sophisticated backdoors like SpyGlace, leading to potential data exfiltration, surveillance, and other malicious activities. Organizations, particularly within targeted regions and sectors, are at elevated risk.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
Organizations using WPS Office should promptly update to the latest version, preferably 12.2.0.17119 or newer, to mitigate risks associated with CVE-2024-7262 and CVE-2024-7263. It's crucial to employ robust monitoring for unusual network traffic and system behavior indicative of malware activity. Additionally, reviewing and strengthening internal protocols around software update deployments can ensure timely application of patches. Sharing indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with APT-C-60, available on GitHub, with network defenders can enhance detection and prevention efforts. Broadly, this incident underscores the need for vigilance and quick response to vulnerability disclosures.
