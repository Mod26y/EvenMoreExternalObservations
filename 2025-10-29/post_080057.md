1) What happened: The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a warning about two actively exploited vulnerabilities in Dassault Systèmes' DELMIA Apriso software, used for manufacturing operations management. The first, CVE-2025-6205, is a critical-severity flaw allowing unauthorized remote access, while the second, CVE-2025-6204, is a high-severity code injection vulnerability requiring high privileges to execute arbitrary code. Dassault patched these vulnerabilities in August 2025, but CISA added them to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as they are being exploited in the wild.

2) Why it matters: These vulnerabilities pose significant risks as they are actively being exploited, potentially allowing unauthorized access and control over systems in critical manufacturing sectors like automotive, electronics, and aerospace. The exploitation of such vulnerabilities could lead to severe operational disruptions, data breaches, and compromised industrial controls. CISA's warning highlights the urgency for organizations using DELMIA Apriso to take action to safeguard their systems, underscoring the broader threat landscape where such critical software flaws are frequent targets for cyber adversaries.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations using DELMIA Apriso should prioritize patching these vulnerabilities by deploying the updates provided by Dassault Systèmes. IT administrators should closely follow the vendor's mitigation instructions and the guidelines in BOD 22-01 for cloud services. For situations where patching is not feasible, consider temporarily discontinuing the use of the product. Organizations are also advised to monitor their systems for signs of exploitation and reevaluate their cybersecurity measures to enhance detection and response capabilities in their manufacturing operations environment.
