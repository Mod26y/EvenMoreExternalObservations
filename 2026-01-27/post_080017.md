Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-malware-service-guarantees-phishing-extensions-on-chrome-web-store/

**What Happened:**  
A new Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering named ‘Stanley’ is providing malicious extensions for the Chrome Web Store, promising they can bypass Google's review process. The service enables attackers to deploy phishing content by overlaying legitimate webpage addresses with deceptive full-screen iframes. This tool supports multiple browsers and utilizes persistent command-and-control polling. Despite technical crudeness, its noteworthy attribute is the ability to slip extensions through security checks.

**Why It Matters:**  
Stanley represents a significant threat due to its ability to bypass the security of one of the most widely used browser extension platforms. This undermines trust in the Chrome Web Store and potentially increases the success rate of phishing attacks. Such capabilities can lead to widespread data breaches and identity theft, especially given the silent auto-installation feature and ability to target users geographically. This makes it essential for organizations to reassess their cybersecurity strategies regarding browser extensions.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**  
Organizations should limit browser extensions to those strictly necessary and vetted for security. Security teams need to educate users about the threat of malicious extensions and develop guidelines for safer browsing practices. Regular security audits should be conducted, focusing on the installed extensions and their permissions. Additionally, collaboration with browser developers to reinforce review processes and detection systems would be beneficial. Investing in anomaly detection tools could also help identify and neutralize similar threats promptly.
