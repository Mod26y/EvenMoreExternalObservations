1) The incident involves a hacking group known as 'Elusive Comet' leveraging Zoom's remote control feature in a social engineering tactic targeted at cryptocurrency users. By posing as legitimate entities like Bloomberg, the attackers schedule fake Zoom interviews with high-value targets. During the Zoom session, they rename their account to mislead victims into granting remote control access, which they use to steal sensitive information and perform unauthorized actions such as initiating crypto transactions. The attack is subtle because it mimicks routine Zoom notifications, exploiting user complacency in approving familiar prompts.

2) This attack matters because it highlights a new dimension of threat actors exploiting remote collaboration tools, which have become ubiquitous due to increased reliance on virtual environments. By targeting the cryptocurrency sector using legitimate platforms, the attackers can bypass traditional detection mechanisms and execute sophisticated heists. The attack emphasizes the growing trend of blending social engineering with technological deception, making it harder for users to differentiate between a real and a malicious request.

3) In response to this threat, organizations should conduct awareness training to sensitize users about these emerging attack vectors, emphasizing the need to critically evaluate unexpected system requests, especially those involving remote control access. Enhancing system security configurations to restrict automatic remote access permissions through tools like Privacy Preferences Policy Control (PPPC) profiles is advisable. Security assessments should weigh the necessity of platforms like Zoom, considering alternative solutions or disabling the remote control feature where feasible, particularly in environments handling sensitive data or digital assets.
