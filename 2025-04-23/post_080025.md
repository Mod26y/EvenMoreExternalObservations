**1) What happened:**

Microsoft addressed a problem with Remote Desktop sessions freezing on Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11 24H2 devices. Windows 11 systems received a fix on February 25 through the KB5052093 update, and Windows Server devices were updated on April 8 with the KB5055523 cumulative update. The February 2025 Security update (KB5051987) initially caused the problem, leading to unresponsive keyboard and mouse inputs during Remote Desktop sessions. Additionally, Microsoft's Known Issue Rollback (KIR) addressed similar problems by reversing problematic updates, and a persistent bug affecting systems with over 256 logical processors was also resolved.

**2) Why it matters:**

This resolution is important for maintaining continuity and reliability in IT operations, especially for organizations heavily reliant on Remote Desktop services. The freezing and disconnection issues could disrupt remote work, affecting productivity and potentially leading to security risks if users are forced to explore less secure ways to access resources. Additionally, addressing bugs that cause blue screens and failed installations on high-performance servers ensures that critical infrastructure remains stable and reliable, minimizing downtime and service disruptions crucial for organizational efficiency.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should ensure all affected Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11 24H2 systems are updated with the latest cumulative patches. IT administrators are advised to monitor system performance post-update, ensuring any reoccurring issues are promptly detected and addressed. Additionally, they should consider revising system monitoring and update deployment strategies to accommodate and swiftly address future updates that might introduce instability. Regular training or briefings for IT staff to stay informed about Microsoft updates and known issues can also aid in proactively managing potential disruptions.
