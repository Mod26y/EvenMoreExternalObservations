In August 2023, Clorox experienced a significant cyberattack after hackers successfully deceived Cognizant's help desk into resetting an employee's password without proper identity verification. The breach, attributed to the group Scattered Spider, allowed attackers to access Clorox's network and cause substantial operational disruption. Clorox has since sued Cognizant for gross negligence, claiming that inadequate security protocols and mismanagement of the incident response exacerbated the attack's impact.

This incident underscores the critical importance of stringent authentication processes for help desks, especially amidst rising social engineering threats. As businesses increasingly rely on IT service providers, robust security protocols and clear communication channels are crucial in preventing and mitigating cyberattacks. The financial and operational repercussions for Clorox highlight the potential vulnerabilities within outsourced IT operations.

Organizations should reevaluate their help desk and IT service provider protocols, ensuring rigorous identity verification and aligning response plans with current threat landscapes. Regular audits, updated training, and strengthened multi-factor authentication can serve as preventive measures. Additionally, businesses may benefit from clarifying the scope of responsibility with IT partners, mitigating risks from misaligned cybersecurity expectations.
