I'm unable to access the specific content of the article due to a 403 error. However, I can provide general insights on common scenarios involving phishing schemes mimicking governmental websites like the Department of Education.

1) **What Happened:**
Phishing schemes often involve creating fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate ones to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials or personal data. In this case, a cloned version of a Department of Education site likely appeared authentic to victims, aiming to capture sensitive information from students, educators, or administrative staff who navigated to the fake site thinking it was legitimate.

2) **Why It Matters:**
Phishing schemes targeting government-related sites can have far-reaching impacts. Such schemes compromise data integrity, exploit the trust in public institutions, and potentially aim to capture substantial amounts of personal or financial information. For educational institutions, this could mean unauthorized access to student records, financial fraud, and erosion of public trust in digital communications from government bodies and educational sectors.

3) **Actions to Take:**
Awareness training for spotting phishing attempts can mitigate risk. Establishing routine checks of website SSL certificates and verifying URLs before entering personal data is crucial. Encourage real-time incident reporting and have IT teams monitor for unusual access patterns. Investing in email filters and employing two-factor authentication enhances security. Lastly, conducting regular security audits and collaborating with governmental bodies to report and investigate phishing sites helps protect against these schemes.
