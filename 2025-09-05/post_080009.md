In the reported incident, threat actors exploited a zero-day vulnerability in legacy Sitecore deployments, identified as CVE-2025-53690. This vulnerability stems from the inclusion of a sample ASP.NET machine key in pre-2017 Sitecore guides. The attackers targeted this flaw to execute remote code, deploying the WeepSteel malware for gathering reconnaissance data, which led to further malicious activities like privilege escalation and data exfiltration. The exploit notably affected the '/sitecore/blocked.aspx' endpoint.

This breach underscores the critical importance of secure software configuration, particularly in legacy systems where outdated practices persist, increasing attack surfaces. Misconfigured or reused machine keys present a substantial risk, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access easily. Such vulnerabilities can escalate rapidly, leading not only to data breaches but also to broader network compromises if left unchecked.

To mitigate these risks, organizations are advised to replace the static ASP.NET machine keys in legacy Sitecore deployments with new, unique keys, and ensure encryption of the <machineKey> element within the web.config file. Regular rotation of machine keys is also suggested, alongside routine security audits and applying best security practices to minimize similar threats in future deployments.
