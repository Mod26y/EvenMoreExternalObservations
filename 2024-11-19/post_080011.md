**What happened:** Brave Browser released version 1.71 for iOS, featuring the new "Shred" button that allows users to delete site-specific data such as cookies and caches from individual websites without affecting data from other sites. This functionality is part of Brave's focus on privacy, particularly addressing concerns about tracking via first-party cookies. Shred can be manually triggered, or set to auto-activate when a site or the browser is closed. However, due to Apple's constraints, some residual data might still persist after using Shred. The Brave team plans to extend this feature to Android and desktop platforms.

**Why it matters:** The Shred feature enhances user control over personal data, improving privacy by allowing selective deletion of data for specific sites, which helps in counteracting tracking and data sharing by third-party entities. Many users are concerned about privacy and the ability to control what information websites retain. This feature caters to those concerns by giving a seamless and efficient way to manage site-specific data, reducing the risk of unwanted tracking which can have implications for data security and personal privacy.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information:** Organizations should evaluate the use of browsers and recommend privacy-focused features like Shred to employees handling sensitive information. Security teams could educate users about best practices for maintaining privacy and limiting data exposure online. Continuous monitoring of privacy tool updates encourages incorporation of such enhancements to bolster security measures. Additionally, organizations might keep an eye on the implementation of similar technologies across different platforms, ensuring consistent protection practices as more browsers adopt such privacy features.
