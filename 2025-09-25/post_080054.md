The article details a vulnerability in the OxygenOS operating system used by OnePlus phones, which can be exploited by any app to access SMS data without requiring permission. Researchers at Rapid7 discovered this security flaw, attributed to modifications in OnePlus's implementation of the Android Telephony package. The flaw, known as CVE-2025-10184, has not been patched, and the exploit details were released after multiple unsuccessful attempts to contact OnePlus.

The vulnerability is significant because OnePlus devices are widely used, including in the US, meaning a large user base is potentially exposed to data breaches without their knowledge. The flaw permits rogue applications to silently access sensitive SMS data, posing risks such as identity theft, unauthorized access to accounts, and privacy violations. The delayed response from OnePlus further exacerbates the situation, raising concerns about the company's vulnerability management and commitment to cybersecurity.

In response, individuals using affected OnePlus devices should limit their installed apps to trusted sources, avoid SMS-based two-factor authentication, and use OTP apps like Google Authenticator instead. For secure communications, users should rely on end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. Organizations responsible for generating security policies might stress the importance of using encrypted apps and regular updates, advising affected users to stay informed on OnePlus's progress in addressing this security flaw.
