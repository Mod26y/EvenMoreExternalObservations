Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-releases-kb5068781-the-first-windows-10-extended-security-update/

**1) What happened:**

Microsoft has issued the KB5068781 update for Windows 10 as part of its Extended Security Update (ESU) program. This is the first such release since Windows 10's end of support. The update corrects a bug that incorrectly claims Windows 10 LTSC devices have ended support, even though they remain supported until January 2027. It also integrates the crucial Patch Tuesday security updates, addressing 63 vulnerabilities, including a critical elevation-of-privilege flaw. A bug affecting some devices' enrollment in the ESU program prompted Microsoft to release an emergency fix.

**2) Why it matters:**

This development is significant as it ensures continued security for organizations that have not transitioned from Windows 10 post its end-of-support phase. Without these updates, systems are vulnerable to known security flaws that attackers could exploit. By addressing a broad array of vulnerabilities, particularly one that is actively exploited, the update plays a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive organizational data and maintaining operational continuity. The provision for extended security also illustrates Microsoft's strategy to bridge the gap for users gradually transitioning to newer operating systems.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

Organizations still operating on Windows 10 should consider enrolling in the ESU program promptly to ensure they continue to receive necessary security updates. This includes addressing the enrollment bug via Microsoft's emergency fix if needed. IT administrators should ensure the KB5068781 update is applied across all Windows 10 devices within their infrastructure. Additionally, organizations should plan for an eventual upgrade to newer operating systems, factoring in Microsoft’s roadmap and support timelines, to avoid future security and compatibility issues. Engaging in training or webinars on efficient patch management may also enhance security posture.
