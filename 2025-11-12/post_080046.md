**1) What happened:**

Microsoft announced that as of November 11, 2025, the Home and Pro editions of Windows 11 version 23H2 will no longer receive security updates. Despite previous alerts, users are advised to upgrade to Windows 11 version 25H2, which provides continued support and security updates until October 2027. The move affects individual users more significantly as enterprise, education, and IoT enterprise editions will continue to receive support until November 2026.

**2) Why it matters:**

Without regular security updates, systems running outdated versions of Windows are susceptible to emerging security threats. This heightened vulnerability can lead to potential breaches, data losses, and exploitation of system weaknesses. For users, maintaining the most secure and updated version of an OS is crucial to protecting sensitive data. For organizations, failing to upgrade could potentially lead to increased risks of cybersecurity incidents, making this a critical issue for risk management.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Users and organizations should prioritize verifying their Windows version and ensuring eligible devices are updated to Windows 11 version 25H2 to continue receiving security patches. IT departments should prepare for and manage the upgrade process across deployed systems, minimizing disruption while ensuring compliance with security practices. Additionally, organizations should review their cybersecurity strategies to ensure alignment with the latest system requirements and threat landscapes. Consideration should also be given to regular training on software update policies and awareness among staff.
