**1) What happened:**

Microsoft has introduced a new feature in Microsoft Teams that automatically alerts users when they send or receive private messages containing potentially harmful links. This feature, aimed at Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Teams enterprise customers, will warn users about URLs flagged as spam, phishing, or malware. The feature is set for a public preview in September 2025 and general availability by November 2025. Admins can enable this feature during the preview and manage its settings through the Teams Admin Center or PowerShell.

**2) Why it matters:**

This development is significant as it enhances the security and user awareness within one of the most widely used collaboration platforms amidst rising cyber threats. With over 320 million monthly active users, Microsoft Teams is a prime target for cybercriminals. By proactively identifying and warning users about malicious URLs, Microsoft aims to reduce the risk of phishing attacks and malware distribution, thereby protecting sensitive organizational data and maintaining communication integrity.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should prepare to integrate this feature by ensuring that IT administrators are aware and ready to enable it once available. Training sessions for employees on recognizing security warnings and understanding the implications of malicious links can enhance user vigilance. Additionally, companies should review their existing security policies and ensure compatibility with the new feature, potentially updating security settings in the Teams Admin Center. Partnering this feature with broader cybersecurity strategies could significantly bolster an organization's defense mechanisms against cyber threats.
