**What happened?**  
U.S. Senator Ron Wyden accused Microsoft of gross cybersecurity negligence for failing to address known security vulnerabilities in its products, contributing to ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure, including healthcare. The senator highlighted Microsoft's prolonged inaction on improving security protocols, evidenced by the 2024 Ascension Health ransomware breach, compromising data of 5.6 million patients. The incident was perpetrated through a "Kerberoasting" attack exploiting weak or easy-to-guess passwords encrypted with the insecure RC4 algorithm, prevalent in older systems, which Microsoft continues to support despite its vulnerabilities.

**Why it matters?**  
The allegations against Microsoft underscore significant weaknesses in cybersecurity practices that have broad implications for national security, given Microsoft’s dominant position in the enterprise operating system market. The persistence of outdated encryption methods like RC4 in widely used systems increases the vulnerability of critical infrastructures to cyber threats. Such security lapses in major software could lead to more frequent and severe cyberattacks, endangering sensitive data of millions and disrupting essential services, notably in healthcare. The issue calls for urgent attention to bolster security measures and protect against further breaches.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**  
Organizations using Microsoft products should immediately reassess their network security configurations, especially concerning Kerberos and RC4 encryption. This includes prioritizing the adoption of more robust encryption standards like AES 128/256. Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities and reinforcing password policies will help mitigate potential threats. Organizations should maintain open communication with Microsoft for guidance on gradual migration plans that minimize disruptions. Furthermore, engaging in regular security audits and threat intelligence updates ensures preparedness against evolving cyber threats. The FTC may need to step up oversight to ensure Microsoft’s timely implementation of improved security measures.
