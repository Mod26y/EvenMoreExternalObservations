**What Happened:**
The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General released a report identifying significant shortcomings within the U.S. Coast Guard regarding maritime cybersecurity. Despite offering free cybersecurity assistance through their Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) since 2021, only 36% of qualifying organizations in the Maritime Transportation System (MTS) took advantage of these services. The Coast Guard lacks the authority to enforce cybersecurity standards and suffers from insufficient staffing, training, and cyber expertise. Additionally, vulnerabilities often go unaddressed due to the industry's reluctance and the Coast Guard's limitations.

**Why it Matters:**
The security of the U.S. maritime supply chain is crucial given its role in global trade and national security. Cyber threats to the MTS are on the rise, with incidents like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ever Given blockage demonstrating the significant impact such disruptions can have. Vulnerabilities in maritime cybersecurity could lead to severe consequences, including physical dangers to crew members and marine life, and disruptions to the supply chain. The lack of adequate cybersecurity measures exposes the maritime sector to risks from cyber espionage, ransomware, and other cyber threats, which can have far-reaching effects on both the economy and national security.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**
Organizations in the MTS should be encouraged to actively engage with the Coast Guardâ€™s CPTs and leverage their expertise in identifying and mitigating cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Increased training and hiring of personnel with specialized cyber skills within the Coast Guard could enhance their ability to manage and enforce cybersecurity standards. Additionally, government and private sector collaboration should be strengthened to build trust and encourage the adoption of recommended cybersecurity practices. Development of a comprehensive strategy involving minimum mandatory cybersecurity requirements and funding for cybersecurity initiatives could significantly enhance maritime security.
