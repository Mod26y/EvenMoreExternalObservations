**1) What happened:**

The article describes concerns raised at the UN's Open-Source Program Officers for Good 2024 conference about the security risks posed by under-resourced maintainers of open source software (OSS) projects, particularly in Africa. Philip Thigo highlighted the engagement of thousands of developers from Africa in global coding activities. However, Omkhar Arasaratnam of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) noted that many OSS maintainers work without sufficient funding or resources, increasing vulnerability to cyber-attacks. A notable example is the multi-year coordinated attack on XZ Utils, which revealed the fragility of single-maintainer projects and the necessity for better resource allocation.

**2) Why it matters:**

This issue matters because the security of OSS directly impacts global technology ecosystems. If OSS projects are compromised due to under-resourced maintainers, it can undermine the reliability of critical software used globally, including in governmental and business operations. For counties like ours, which may rely on OSS for various applications, this represents a serious supply chain risk. Ensuring the security of these systems is essential to avoid scenarios where our residents could be affected by both cybersecurity and other societal issues due to insecure software components.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

Given the risks highlighted, it would be prudent to adopt several measures. Firstly, implementing tools like Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) can aid in identifying and managing OSS dependencies. Additionally, allocating resources to support and secure the OSS projects relied upon by the county could enhance security. Encouraging developers to undertake security training, such as those provided by OpenSSF, could also be beneficial. Lastly, collaborating with organizations like CISA to recognize and secure essential OSS projects and using tools like Scorecard and Sigstore might help ensure robust OSS security practices within the county's technology infrastructure.
