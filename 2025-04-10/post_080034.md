In the recent campaign discovered by F5 Labs, hackers targeted Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) bugs in websites hosted on AWS EC2 instances to extract EC2 metadata, including sensitive IAM credentials from the IMDSv1 endpoint. The attacks, concentrated in March 2025, involved systematic probes from specific IPs in France and Romania. These vulnerabilities allowed attackers to escalate privileges, potentially accessing multiple AWS services and exposing sensitive data.

This incident is important because it highlights the continued exploitation of SSRF vulnerabilities, especially leveraging older systems like AWS's IMDSv1. Such exploits can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and service interruptions, underscoring the need for robust security practices. Additionally, as the campaign shows exploitation of known vulnerabilities, it emphasizes the risks posed by legacy systems and outdated security measures in cloud environments.

In response, organizations should migrate from IMDSv1 to IMDSv2, which employs session tokens for added security. Regular vulnerability assessments and patch management are crucial to address both new and older vulnerabilities. Further, enhancing AWS security configurations, closely monitoring network traffic, and employing behavior analytics can offer early detection of such exploits. It's also important to implement a comprehensive incident response strategy to swiftly address potential breaches.
