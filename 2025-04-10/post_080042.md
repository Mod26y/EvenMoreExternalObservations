**1) What happened:**

Oracle confirmed that a hacker accessed and leaked credentials from two obsolete servers associated with Oracle's earlier infrastructure, referred to as Oracle Cloud Classic. While authentication data from these outdated servers was compromised, Oracle emphasized that its current Oracle Cloud infrastructure (OCI) was not breached. The exposed data reportedly included user emails and hashed passwords, yet Oracle insists no customer environments or data within Oracle Cloud were impacted. This breach involved legacy servers unused since 2017, contradicting claims by threat actors that newer data was compromised.

**2) Why it matters:**

Even though Oracleâ€™s current cloud infrastructure was not directly breached, the incident underscores vulnerabilities associated with legacy systems, which often go unpatched and may still hold sensitive data. Organizations must understand the significance of lifecycle management for IT systems, as outdated platforms pose critical risks. Additionally, the incident highlights the importance of transparent communication from vendors to maintain client trust. Public perception can be influenced by such breaches, as distinctions between old and current systems may seem like strategic wordplay, thus potentially diminishing a vendor's credibility.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should conduct regular audits of all IT systems to identify and address obsolete infrastructure. Implementing robust data governance policies concerning decommissioned platforms is vital to mitigate risks. Establish comprehensive incident response plans that encompass transparent communication strategies, ensuring stakeholders are informed promptly and clearly. Additionally, prioritize continuous monitoring and updating of security protocols for all systems, even those considered legacy, to prevent exploitation. Entities must also engage in a dialogue with service providers about the scope of their services and security practices, ensuring a sound understanding of protections in place.
