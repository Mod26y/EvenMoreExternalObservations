Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-cophish-attack-steals-oauth-tokens-via-copilot-studio-agents/

**What Happened:**  
The CoPhish attack leverages Microsoft Copilot Studio agents to facilitate phishing by delivering fraudulent OAuth consent requests. Developed by Datadog Security Labs, this technique exploits the flexibility of Copilot Studio agents to create legitimate-appearing applications that lure victims into granting unauthorized access. Attackers can customize the login button to mislead users and collect OAuth tokens under the guise of trusted Microsoft domains. This allows threat actors to execute social engineering attacks that capture sensitive credentials without triggering user suspicion, exploiting the security posture of Microsoft's governance and consent mechanisms.

**Why It Matters:**  
The CoPhish attack underscores significant vulnerabilities in cloud-based platforms that leverage popular applications like Microsoft's Copilot Studio. It highlights the risks posed by social engineering, where the trust vested in legitimate platforms is exploited to acquire unauthorized access through OAuth token theft. The attack exploits weaknesses in application consent processes, potentially exposing sensitive administrative roles to threats that can manipulate multi-tenant ecosystems. Given the widespread use of Microsoft services, such vulnerabilities have expansive implications not only for individual organizations but also for the broader security ecosystem.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**  
Organizations are advised to restrict administrative privileges and tailor application permissions to minimize exposure to OAuth token theft. Implementing stringent application consent policies and disabling default user application creation can reduce vulnerabilities. Monitoring application consent activities in services like Entra ID and auditing Copilot Studio agent creation events can further bolster defenses. Continuous education on phishing tactics and rigorous governance combined with Microsoft's pending updates will contribute to more robust security postures against emerging threats like CoPhish.
