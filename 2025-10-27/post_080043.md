1) What happened: A phishing campaign, attributed to the CryptoChameleon threat group, is targeting LastPass users by sending fraudulent emails claiming a family member has requested access to their password vault through the legacy inheritance feature. These emails contain fake death claims prompting users to click a link, which leads to a fraudulent login page, seeking to capture usersâ€™ master passwords and passkeys. The campaign is financially motivated and linked to previous attacks, focusing on cryptocurrency theft by leveraging spoofed domains for phishing.

2) Why it matters: This phishing campaign highlights the evolving tactics of threat actors, who exploit the trust inherent in emergency access features of password managers to trick users into divulging sensitive information. The introduction of passkey-focused attacks symbolizes a shift in targeting new passwordless authentication standards, which are commonly believed to be more secure. As password managers contain sensitive data, including credentials for financial accounts, a breach can lead to substantial financial losses and compromise of personal security.

3) What actions should be taken: Users of password managers should remain vigilant for suspicious emails, particularly those purporting to be part of an inheritance request. They should verify any such requests through official channels and avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails. Organizations should educate employees and users about phishing tactics and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security. Updating security protocols to include alerts for unusual login attempts and regularly reviewing access requests can help in early detection of fraudulent activities.
