1) What happened: Google announced it will distrust root CA certificates from Chunghwa Telecom and Netlock in the Chrome Root Store starting on August 1, 2025. This decision stems from observed compliance failures and unmet improvement commitments by these CAs, reducing Google's confidence in their reliability as certificate issuers. As a result, Google Chrome will alert users with "Your connection is not private" warnings when visiting sites using these certificates, affecting their web experience and potentially undermining user trust.

2) Why it matters: This action highlights the importance of compliance and trust in digital certificate management. Websites relying on Chunghwa Telecom or Netlock certificates will face trust issues, potentially disrupting user access and eroding confidence in their security. With secure HTTPS connections being pivotal for user safety and privacy, organizations must ensure their digital certificates are issued by reputable CAs to maintain uninterrupted service and preserve user trust.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations using certificates from Chunghwa Telecom or Netlock should proactively transition to a more trusted CA before August 1, 2025, to avoid the connection warnings in Google Chrome. They should conduct an audit of their current digital certificates, identify any associated with these CAs, and start the process of replacement. Additionally, IT teams should stay informed of browser trust changes and compliance expectations, and continually assess their cybersecurity practices to avoid future disruptions.
