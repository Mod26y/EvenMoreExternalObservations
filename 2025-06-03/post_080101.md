**What happened:** The Emergency Management and Response Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EMR-ISAC) has been shut down. This development signifies the closure of a critical hub that facilitated the exchange of cybersecurity threat intelligence and best practices among emergency management professionals. Without access to these resources, agencies may experience challenges in maintaining robust cybersecurity defenses and staying informed about emerging threats.

**Why it matters:** The shutdown of EMR-ISAC matters because it potentially leaves a gap in the cybersecurity posture of emergency management and response organizations. These agencies rely on timely intelligence and collaboration to protect critical infrastructure and ensure efficient response during incidents. The absence of an established platform for information sharing could result in slower response times and weaker safeguards against cyber threats, affecting the resilience and security of essential services.

**What actions should be taken:** As a result of this information, organizations should seek alternative channels for threat intelligence and collaboration to ensure continuity in their cybersecurity efforts. This could involve joining other ISACs or cybersecurity alliances, fostering direct communication lines with peer agencies, or investing in internal capabilities to monitor and address cybersecurity threats autonomously. Policies may need to be adjusted to promote proactive and sustained information sharing and threat management practices across the organization.
