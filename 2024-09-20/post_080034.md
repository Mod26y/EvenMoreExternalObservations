### 1) What happened
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) has highlighted five new flaws in its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. Among these is CVE-2024-27348, a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting Apache HugeGraph-Server. This bug, impacting versions from 1.0.0 up to but not including 1.3.0, has already been patched by Apache as of April 22, 2024. The vulnerability allows improper access control, which could enable malicious actors to execute arbitrary code remotely. Active exploitation of this vulnerability has already been observed in the wild.

### 2) Why it matters
The active exploitation of CVE-2024-27348 is a significant concern due to the widespread use of Apache HugeGraph-Server in critical sectors like telecommunications, financial services, and social networking. The vulnerability's high criticality score (CVSS 9.8) indicates severe potential impacts, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and disruption of services. Given that the server deals with large-scale graph data necessary for intricate operations like fraud detection and network analysis, exploitation can lead to substantial financial and operational risks for organizations.

### 3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information
Organizations using Apache HugeGraph-Server should upgrade to version 1.3.0 immediately to mitigate the CVE-2024-27348 vulnerability. Apart from updating, they should also switch to Java 11 and enable the authentication system for added security. Employing the "Whitelist-IP/port" function will further secure the RESTful-API execution. Regularly monitoring the environment for any signs of exploit attempts and applying timely software patches can help prevent unauthorized access. Security teams should also review and update their incident response plans to ensure quick action if exploitation is detected.
