**1. What happened?**

Ukraine's National Coordination Centre for Cybersecurity (NCCC) has announced a ban on the use of the Telegram messaging app within government agencies, military units, and critical infrastructure sectors. This decision, highlighted during a meeting on September 19, is driven by national security concerns amidst the ongoing war with Russia. The ban comes after warnings that Russian intelligence services could exploit Telegram for accessing users' data and coordinating cyberattacks. Notably, this restriction does not extend to ordinary civilians, who will continue to use the app for communication and news dissemination, including updates from Ukrainian officials.

**2. Why it matters?**

The ban on Telegram by Ukrainian authorities underlines significant cybersecurity risks associated with the app, especially in a context of ongoing conflict with Russia. Given that Telegram can be used by adversarial forces for intelligence gathering, phishing, and coordinating attacks, its unrestricted use poses severe national security threats. This measure is crucial to safeguard sensitive information within government and military operations and prevent critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hostile actors, particularly Russian intelligence services.

**3. What actions should be taken?**

As a consequence of this information, it is imperative for organizations, particularly those in sensitive sectors, to review the use of communication apps within their operations and ensure they adhere to secure messaging practices. Conducting a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities posed by third-party applications would be prudent. In addition, implementing strict policies and providing cybersecurity training to employees can enhance overall security posture. Monitoring developments in cybersecurity best practices and staying informed about app vulnerabilities should be continual to mitigate risks effectively.
