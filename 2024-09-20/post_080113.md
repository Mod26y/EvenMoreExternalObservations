1) **What Happened:** CrowdStrike announced the launch of its second annual Cybersecurity Startup Accelerator in partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and NVIDIA. This program aims to support emerging cybersecurity startups across the U.S. and EMEA by providing mentorship, technical expertise, funding, and market opportunities. The Accelerator program invites applications through early January 2025 and will culminate in a Demo Day during the RSA Conference in April 2025.

2) **Why It Matters:** This initiative is significant as it fosters innovation in the rapidly evolving fields of AI and cloud security. By leveraging the resources and expertise of CrowdStrike, AWS, and NVIDIA, the Accelerator can help position startups for success, potentially leading to significant advancements in cybersecurity technologies. This mutual collaboration could also benefit large entities like our county by accelerating the introduction of cutting-edge security solutions that can counter new and sophisticated cyber threats.

3) **What Actions Should Be Taken:** The information security steering committee should consider monitoring the innovations and developments emerging from the Accelerator program, as these startups are likely to introduce next-generation cybersecurity solutions. Engaging with the program or its participants at the RSA Conference in 2025 might provide early access to innovative technologies that could enhance the county's cybersecurity posture. Additionally, partnering or collaborating with burgeoning startups or even applying for similar programs may prove valuable.
