### 1) What Happened

c/side, a cybersecurity firm specializing in monitoring and securing browser-based third-party scripts, secured $6 million in seed funding led by Uncork Capital. This funding aims to develop c/side’s flagship proxy solution and enhance its AI-driven detection engine. The company's technology addresses vulnerabilities in third-party scripts used in web functionalities like analytics and chatbots, which are often exploited by malicious actors. This funding will also support scaling their team and expanding customer service, sales, and marketing.

### 2) Why It Matters

The increasing frequency and sophistication of browser supply chain attacks pose significant risks to businesses by allowing cybercriminals to steal sensitive information or manipulate website content through poorly monitored third-party scripts. This presents a direct threat to organizations, affecting data integrity and compliance with stringent regulations such as PCI DSS 4.0. c/side’s innovation in real-time detection and neutralization of malicious scripts is crucial for protecting digital operations and enhancing overall website security, performance, and regulatory compliance.

### 3) What Actions Should Be Taken

Organizations should review their current web security protocols, particularly focusing on third-party scripts’ oversight. Investing in solutions that offer real-time monitoring and AI-driven threat detection, like those provided by c/side, can significantly mitigate risks associated with browser supply chain attacks. Additionally, maintaining ongoing visibility and not adopting a "set it and forget it" approach will be vital in adapting to the evolving threat landscape. Establishing partnerships with cybersecurity firms specializing in browser-side protection can also bolster an organization’s defensive measures.
