**What happened:**
Organizations are increasingly adopting Single Sign-On (SSO) and passkeys as solutions to address the persistent issue of poor password practices among users. The reliance on traditional passwords often leads to vulnerabilities due to users creating weak or reused passwords. By transitioning to SSO, users benefit from a simplified authentication process requiring a single set of credentials. Meanwhile, passkeys eliminate the need for passwords altogether by using cryptographic keys for secure authentication.

**Why it matters:**
The adoption of SSO and passkeys is a significant development in enhancing organizational cybersecurity. Weak passwords are a common attack vector for cyber threats, leading to breaches and data compromises. By streamlining and securing the authentication process, organizations reduce the risk of unauthorized access. This shift is not only about improving security but also about enhancing user experience by reducing the cognitive load associated with remembering multiple credentials.

**What actions should be taken:**
Organizations might consider evaluating their current authentication strategies to determine the feasibility of implementing SSO and passkeys. This involves assessing technical requirements, potential vendor solutions, and the impact on users. Education and awareness campaigns could support a smooth transition by informing users about the security benefits and operational convenience. It is also advisable to integrate robust logging and monitoring to detect potential anomalies in authentication activities.
