1) *What happened*: The article discusses the heightened risk of cybersecurity breaches caused by interconnected global supply chains, particularly through third-party vendors. The Cyentia Institute reports that 98% of organizations have experienced a third-party breach in the last two years. In response, organizations are investing more in third-party risk management (TPRM) programs. The article emphasizes the importance of threat intelligence in managing these risks effectively, leveraging information from various sources to understand the threat landscape and identify at-risk third parties.

2) *Why it matters*: This matter is critically important due to the growing dependency on third-party vendors, which expands an organization's attack surface. A breach in a third-party's security can compromise sensitive data, leading to financial loss, regulatory penalties, and damage to reputation. With regulatory pressures and the increase of remote work, investing in robust TPRM programs and threat intelligence solutions becomes vital to ensuring that organizations can preemptively identify and mitigate potential risks from third parties.

3) *What actions should be taken*: Organizations should prioritize enhancing their TPRM programs by incorporating comprehensive threat intelligence strategies. This involves gathering data from open-source intelligence, commercial providers, and internal security data to monitor third parties continuously. Implementing situational awareness programs will allow organizations to detect early signs of potential threats, such as leaked credentials or data in online forums. Additionally, fostering partnership with industry-specific information sharing and analysis centers can enrich the threat intelligence landscape, thereby improving the overall efficacy of risk management processes.
