1) The article highlights a concerning increase in cyberattacks targeting vehicles, with a 45% rise in attacks and four times the number of hackers involved. This surge is indicative of the growing interest and capability among cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in connected vehicle systems. These threats are becoming more sophisticated, potentially compromising not only personal data but also the safety and functionality of automotive systems.

2) The matter is significant as it underscores the critical need for heightened cybersecurity in an increasingly digital and interconnected automotive industry. Vehicles now host more connected technologies than ever before, making them lucrative targets for cybercriminals. Compromises could lead to severe consequences, including breaches of privacy, theft of sensitive information, or even endangerment of passengers' physical safety.

3) Stakeholders should prioritize enhancing cybersecurity measures in vehicles by investing in robust security protocols and regular vulnerability assessments. It is advisable to maintain updated software and firmware and adopt robust encryption techniques for data in transit and at rest. Collaboration with cybersecurity experts for developing comprehensive security frameworks will be beneficial, along with increasing awareness through training for developers and consumers on safeguarding their connected vehicles.
