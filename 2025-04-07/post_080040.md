Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/coinbase-to-fix-2fa-account-activity-entry-freaking-out-users/

**1) What happened:**  
Coinbase users experienced confusion and anxiety due to misleading error messages appearing in their account activity logs, stating "second_factor_failure" or "2-step verification failed." These entries emerged after inadvertent entry of incorrect 2FA codes or passwords and led users to believe their credentials might be compromised. Misinterpretations made users think a breach occurred, prompting them to change passwords and check for malware. Coinbase acknowledged the issue and plans to revise the error message to clarify its meaning, although no timeline for the fix has been provided. These error messages have also been linked to social engineering attacks by threat actors.

**2) Why it matters:**  
This issue highlights the critical importance of clear communication in cybersecurity measures, as misleading messages can cause unwarranted panic among users, leading to unnecessary actions and increased vulnerability to social engineering attacks. Misunderstandings about login attempts and 2FA failures can undermine trust in a platform and expose users to phishing and social engineering tactics that exploit this confusion. Addressing these errors promptly is essential to maintaining user confidence and security, preventing potential exploitation by malicious actors.

**3) What actions should be taken:**  
Coinbase is already working on modifying the error messages for clarity. Users should remain vigilant and educated about legitimate communication from Coinbase, disregarding unsolicited texts or calls. Implementing educational campaigns to inform users about interpreting account activity logs and recognizing phishing attempts would further reduce susceptibility to exploitation. Ensuring regular software updates and continuous monitoring for unusual activities remains vital. By promoting user awareness and enhancing communication, Coinbase can both protect and empower its user base against potential threats.
