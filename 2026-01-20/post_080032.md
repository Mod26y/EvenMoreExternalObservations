**What happened:**

OpenAI has temporarily made its ChatGPT Plus subscription, typically priced at $20 per month, available for free to select users. This comes after previously only ChatGPT Go had been offered at a discounted price. The free access to ChatGPT Plus, which will eventually renew automatically at the regular fee unless canceled, is now being extended to all interested parties. This offer, although temporary, provides access to enhanced features designed for tasks requiring higher-level reasoning and larger memory capacity.

**Why it matters:**

This promotion marks a strategic move by OpenAI to widen user exposure to higher-tier services and potentially increase its subscription base by showcasing the benefits that come with ChatGPT Plus. Offering such a service for free could introduce more individuals and organizations to the possibilities of AI, promoting its incorporation in professional environments, enhancing workflows, and influencing subscriptions post-trial period. It may also affect the AI subscription market by setting a precedent for temporary free trials.

**What actions should be taken:**

Organizations and individuals should take advantage of this free upgrade to evaluate the Plus service's impact on their operations without incurring initial costs. IT and security teams should monitor data usage and permissions within these enhanced AI interactions, establishing clear guidelines to ensure data privacy and compliance. With OpenAI's pending advertising strategy, users should be informed about data-handling practices during their interactions. Additionally, organizations should consider reviewing the associated security best practices to manage AI tool integration securely.
