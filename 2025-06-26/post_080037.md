**1) What happened?**

The OneClik campaign leverages Microsoftâ€™s ClickOnce deployment technology and AWS cloud services to launch stealthy cyberattacks targeting the energy, oil, and gas sectors. Researchers at Trellix identified that threat actors are utilizing ClickOnce to deploy malicious payloads without user account control, enabling the execution of a Golang-based backdoor called RunnerBeacon. This malware communicates with its operators by masquerading as legitimate cloud service traffic, complicating detection efforts. The attack uses disguised phishing emails to deliver ClickOnce manifests that execute and persist malicious activity under legitimate user privileges.

**2) Why it matters?**

The OneClik campaign illustrates a significant threat to critical infrastructure sectors by using well-regarded cloud services for cloaking command and control operations, enhancing the sophistication and difficulty of detecting these attacks. By exploiting trusted platforms like ClickOnce and AWS, attackers bypass traditional security measures and gain persistent access to targeted networks. This campaign underscores the evolving complexity of cyber threats, highlighting the need for enhanced monitoring of cloud service usage and the potential risks of assuming the security of legitimate tools and services.

**3) What actions should be taken?**

Organizations, particularly in the energy sector, should increase vigilance around cloud service usage and enhance their security monitoring capabilities to detect abnormal patterns indicating potential compromise. Implementing advanced threat detection solutions capable of analyzing behavioral anomalies and de-obfuscating encrypted traffic could help in identifying malicious activities that exploit legitimate cloud services. Additionally, cybersecurity teams should review and update incident response plans to address sophisticated phishing tactics and be prepared to track and respond to breaches that leverage cloud-native platforms for stealth. Developing partnerships for threat intelligence sharing could also provide timely information on similar campaigns and emerging threats.
