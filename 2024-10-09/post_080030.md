Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-windows-11-22h2-home-and-pro-reached-end-of-servicing/

1) What happened: Microsoft announced that several editions of Windows 11, specifically 22H2 Home, Pro, Pro Education, Pro for Workstations, and SE, have reached the end of their servicing period, meaning they will no longer receive monthly security or preview updates. This impacts users on these editions by potentially exposing them to security threats due to lack of updates. To mitigate this, Microsoft will automatically initiate feature updates to the latest version for devices not managed by IT departments. However, users have a degree of control over the timing of these updates to accommodate their schedules.

2) Why it matters: The end of servicing for these Windows 11 editions means users will no longer receive critical updates that protect against security threats, leaving their systems vulnerable to potential attacks. This highlights the importance of keeping operating systems updated for security and operational efficiency. As newer updates are rolled out, the risk of incompatibility with existing software and drivers increases, potentially leading to system instability issues such as BSOD. Therefore, this announcement emphasizes the critical need for both awareness and proactive system management.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations and individual users should ensure that their systems are updated to the latest version of Windows 11 by enabling automatic updates and checking their systems' compatibility with new updates using Microsoftâ€™s tools. They should also evaluate any critical applications and drivers for compatibility issues highlighted by Microsoft and address these proactively. For IT-managed devices, a review of the update policy may be needed to ensure proper transitioning, maintaining security without disrupting productivity. Regular monitoring of Microsoft's announcements for any new compatibility issues or safeguard holds is also advisable.
