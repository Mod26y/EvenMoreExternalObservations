In recent ransomware campaigns, the Akira group is exploiting SonicWall SSL VPN devices, despite enabled Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). They likely use stolen one-time password (OTP) seeds from earlier breaches. These attacks root back to an improper access control flaw, CVE-2024-40766, despite SonicWall’s patching of the vulnerability. Reports suggest that threat actors log into accounts by validating OTP challenges, hinting at potentially compromised OTP seeds, or they might have developed a way to create valid tokens independently of SonicWall’s systems.

The incident underscores the evolving nature of cyber threats, where traditional security measures like MFA are bypassed, showing that patching vulnerabilities alone may not preclude further attacks. This scenario highlights sophisticated techniques such as generating valid OTPs through compromised seeds, which may pose substantial risks given renowned trust in MFA systems. As threat actors adapt quickly to security updates and mitigation measures, organizations must reassess their security postures to counteract these advanced tactics.

In response, organizations should consider actions such as auditing and resetting all affected VPN credentials, implementing enhanced monitoring for suspicious activity, and applying multiple layers of security beyond MFA. They can also engage in proactive threat intelligence and analysis to detect potential attack vectors early. Educating users about recognizing phishing attempts that might precede such breaches is crucial, as well as reinforcing robust security policies, reviewing security configurations, and utilizing threat detection tools to identify unusual activities swiftly.
