1) The article discusses a cyberattack by a Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group using a sophisticated malware called 'Brickstorm' to plant backdoors on edge devices. These devices often serve as crucial gateways in networks, and the backdoors potentially grant unauthorized access and control to the attackers. The backdoors typically bypass traditional security measures, increasing the risk of data breaches and network intrusions without immediate detection by conventional security systems.

2) This incident is significant because it underscores the ongoing threat of state-sponsored hacking groups targeting critical infrastructure globally. Edge devices are becoming increasingly integral to organizational networks due to the rise of IoT and modern connectivity demands. Compromising these devices can lead to significant security breaches, data theft, and system shutdowns. It highlights the need to prioritize the security of edge devices, which are often overlooked compared to central network elements.

3) As a response, organizations should conduct comprehensive security evaluations of their edge devices to identify vulnerabilities. Enhancing monitoring systems to detect unusual activities around these devices is critical. Employing intrusion detection systems and endpoint protection on all network layers can help mitigate these risks. Additionally, organizations are encouraged to stay updated with threat intelligence reports to quickly adapt to evolving attack methods used by APT groups. Investing in continuous employee training about cybersecurity threats ensures preparedness against potential breaches initiated via these backdoors.
