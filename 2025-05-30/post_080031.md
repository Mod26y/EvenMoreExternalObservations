Threat actors have exploited Google Apps Script to create and host phishing pages that convincingly mimic legitimate login screens, enabling them to steal credentials from unsuspecting users. The attackers distribute phishing emails masquerading as legitimate invoices, which direct recipients to a page hosted within Google's trusted domain. This tactic leverages Google's trusted environment to bypass security measures, exfiltrating user-entered credentials covertly to the attackers' server. 

The significance of this development lies in its ability to exploit perceived trust in Google's infrastructure, thus enhancing the phishing campaign's credibility and effectiveness. Traditional phishing defenses may fail to detect these sophisticated attempts due to their legitimate Google domain origin, magnifying the risk of credential compromise. The threat actors' ability to dynamically alter phishing scripts without triggering security alarms further complicates detection and prevention efforts.

Organizations should enhance their email security systems to scrutinize links pointing to cloud services, particularly those involving Google Apps Script. Educating employees on identifying phishing attempts, despite their official appearance, is crucial. Implementing policies that either block or flag Google Apps Script URLs for additional inspection can reduce vulnerability. Collaboration with service providers like Google for improving detection and response mechanisms against such abuses should also be considered.
