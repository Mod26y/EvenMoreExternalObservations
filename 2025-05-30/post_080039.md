A vulnerability in Apple's Safari browser allows attackers to employ the fullscreen browser-in-the-middle (BitM) tactic to steal users' login credentials. By exploiting the Fullscreen API, attackers disguise phishing windows as legitimate sites, tricking users into entering sensitive data. This attack is especially effective on Safari, as it lacks prominent warnings when entering fullscreen mode, unlike its Chromium-based counterparts. 

This matter is significant due to the increasing reliance on digital services, where such vulnerabilities can lead to widespread credential theft. The lack of adequate safeguards in Safari highlights the potential risks for users in environments where continuous online authentication is necessary. Such attacks underscore the need for heightened vigilance in cybersecurity practices.

To mitigate the risks, users should remain cautious of URLs, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and employ security extensions to enhance browser safety. Organizations can conduct awareness campaigns informing users about disguising attacks and encourage using browsers with more visible security features. Developers might consider implementing third-party tools or waiting for updates that improve Safari's alert system around fullscreen transitions.
