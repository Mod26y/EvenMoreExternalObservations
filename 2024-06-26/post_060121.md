### What Happened
A threat actor infiltrated the source code of at least five WordPress plugins hosted on WordPress.org, embedding malicious PHP scripts. These scripts create administrative accounts on websites using the compromised plugins. The breach was detected by the Wordfence Threat Intelligence team and appears to have occurred on June 21-22. Upon discovering the issue, Wordfence alerted plugin developers, resulting in security patches for most affected plugins. Approximately 35,000 websites are reportedly using these compromised plugins. Malicious code specifically designed to create new admin accounts and inject SEO spam has been identified.

### Why It Matters
This supply chain attack poses significant risks to the integrity and security of websites using the affected WordPress plugins. Compromised administrative accounts enable attackers to exert full control over victim websites, hijacking them for malicious activities such as injecting SEO spam, data theft, and distribution of further malware. Given the widespread use of these plugins across thousands of websites, the potential impact on website owners and their users is substantial. Rapid detection and response are critical to mitigating further damage and preventing extended exploitation of the compromised websites.

### Actions to Take
Website administrators should first verify if their sites are using any of the compromised plugins. If identified, affected plugins need to be updated to the latest patched versions immediately. Moreover, administrators should perform comprehensive malware scans to detect and remove any unauthorized admin accounts or injected malicious code. Suspicious traffic to the specified IP address (94.156.79[.]8) should be investigated. As a precautionary measure, heightened monitoring and security audits of other installed plugins are recommended to identify any additional vulnerabilities or unauthorized changes. Enhanced vigilance in monitoring for further suspicious activities should be maintained in the short term.
