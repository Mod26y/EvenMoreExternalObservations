### What Happened

A cybersecurity breach involving five WordPress plugins occurred, during which threat actors modified the plugins' source code to embed malicious PHP scripts. This malicious code creates new administrative user accounts on websites using these plugins, thereby allowing the attackers to control the websites. The compromised plugins have been installed on over 35,000 websites. The Wordfence Threat Intelligence team discovered the breach and notified the plugin developers, resulting in patches for most of the affected plugins. An investigation is ongoing to determine how the attackers gained access to the source code.

### Why It Matters

This supply chain attack underlines the vulnerability of even widely-used and trusted alternatives in an open-source ecosystem like WordPress. The creation of unauthorized admin accounts exposes affected websites to a host of security issues, including data theft, spam injection, and further malware infections. Given the prevalence of WordPress, this incident potentially compromises a significant number of websites, affecting business operations, customer data, and trustworthiness. For a large county using similar technologies, the event emphasizes the importance of vigilant plugin management and prompt incident response to mitigate risks and maintain public trust.

### Recommended Actions

Website administrators should immediately verify whether any of the identified compromised plugins are in use. If so, they should conduct a full malware scan and remove any suspicious admin accounts, such as "Options" and "PluginAuth." Updating the affected plugins to their patched versions, where available, is also crucial. Additionally, monitoring traffic to suspicious IP addresses, including 94.156.79[.]8, can help identify further malicious activities. Given the nature of this attack, institutionalizing a protocol for regular security audits and implementing more stringent controls over third-party software integrations can serve as preventive measures against future supply chain attacks.
