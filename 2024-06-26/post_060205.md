### What Happened

Indonesia was targeted by a significant cyberattack, leading to the demand of an $8 million ransom from the attackers. Indonesia refused to comply with the ransom demands, opting instead to address the situation through other cybersecurity measures and law enforcement interventions. This stance indicates a strategic decision to avoid funding criminal activities and sets a precedent for handling similar threats in the future.

### Why It Matters

The incident highlights the ever-present risk of cyberattacks and the difficult decisions that follow. By refusing to pay the ransom, Indonesia avoids setting a harmful precedent that could encourage further attacks. This approach underscores the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures and incident response plans. For large public entities, such actions resonate globally, reinforcing the importance of resilience and strategic planning in the face of ransomware threats.

### Actions to be Taken

Organizations should bolster their ransomware defenses and establish clear protocols for incident response. Training for staff on recognizing phishing attempts and other common attack vectors is essential. Additionally, entities should ensure regular backups of critical data and systems, stored securely off-network, to prevent operational disruptions. Engaging in regular cybersecurity drills and reassessing cybersecurity insurance policies also contribute to organizational resilience against similar threats.
