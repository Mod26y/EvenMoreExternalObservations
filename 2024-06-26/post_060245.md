**1. What Happened?**
In October 2023, the British Library suffered a debilitating cyberattack that incapacitated its website and numerous online services, including card transactions, reader registrations, ticket sales, and access to its digital catalog. The attack inflicted Â£7 million (approximately US$8.9 million) in recovery costs, roughly 40% of its reserve budget. Unauthorized access was traced to a Terminal Services server installed during the COVID era, which lacked multifactor authentication. Rhysida, a notorious ransomware group, claimed responsibility, exfiltrating 600GB of sensitive data and demanding 20 bitcoins in ransom. After the library refused to pay, the attackers leaked data on the dark web.

**2. Why It Matters**
This attack highlights the severe vulnerabilities and potential catastrophic impact on public institutions with extensive data repositories and legacy systems. The incident underscores the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures, such as multifactor authentication, regular assessments of technical debt, and comprehensive information governance. The breach also demonstrates the devastating financial implications and operational disruptions that can arise from inadequate security protocols. The British Library's experience serves as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and proactive defense strategies to mitigate risks.

**3. Actions to Take**
Organizations should prioritize evaluating and addressing technical debt to close security gaps posed by outdated hardware and software. Maintaining a comprehensive understanding of cyber risks is crucial for informed decision-making and resource allocation. Implementing a defense-in-depth strategy, including segmentation and multifactor authentication, can significantly limit the damage of cyber intrusions. Regular simulation exercises can identify vulnerabilities and enhance response readiness. Investing in a dedicated, knowledgeable security team can improve incident response efficiency. By adopting these measures, organizations can better protect themselves against sophisticated cyber threats and minimize potential damage.
