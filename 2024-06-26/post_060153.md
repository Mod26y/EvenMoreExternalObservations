### What Happened:
The FBI has issued a warning concerning cybercriminals who pose as law firms and lawyers, ostensibly offering cryptocurrency recovery services to victims of crypto investment scams. These fraudsters build a facade of legitimacy by claiming associations with government agencies like the FBI and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and by referencing real financial institutions and money exchanges. They lure victims into providing personal and banking information, stating judgment amounts sought, and paying fees upfront or back taxes, all under the pretense of recovering lost funds. Between February 2023 and February 2024, victims reportedly lost over $9 million to these schemes.

### Why It Matters:
This issue is significant because it adds an additional layer of victimization for those already affected by crypto investment scams, exacerbating their financial and emotional toll. The tactics employed by these fraudsters, such as claiming collaborations with government agencies and referencing real institutions, make it difficult for victims to discern the legitimacy of these recovery offers, increasing their vulnerability. This scam not only results in financial loss but also compromises victims' personal and banking data, exposing them to further risks like identity theft and additional financial fraud.

### Actions to Take:
Authorities and organizations should focus on raising awareness about the nature of these scams and the signs to watch for, such as unsolicited contacts claiming to recover lost crypto for a fee. Victims of such scams should be encouraged to report incidents to the IC3 portal and share as much detail as possible to assist in investigations. Additionally, implementing stronger education initiatives around the proper channels and procedures for recovering lost cryptocurrency, including emphasizing that legitimate recovery efforts do not involve upfront fees or unsolicited contacts, can greatly reduce the risk of falling prey to such scams.
