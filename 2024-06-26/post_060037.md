1) **What Happened:**
The FBI issued a warning about cybercriminals posing as law firms and lawyers to offer fraudulent cryptocurrency recovery services to victims of investment scams. These criminals deceive victims by claiming affiliations with legitimate government agencies and financial institutions. Their tactics include requesting personal or banking information, demanding upfront fees, and instructing victims to pay back taxes and other charges to supposedly recover their funds. According to the FBI, victims have lost over $9 million to such scams between February 2023 and February 2024.

2) **Why It Matters:**
This issue is significant because it exacerbates the financial and emotional damage already sustained by initial cryptocurrency scam victims. The involvement of cybercriminals pretending to offer recovery services can lead to further loss of funds and the potential misuse of sensitive personal and financial information. This phenomenon stresses the importance of public awareness and vigilance in discerning credible recovery services from fraudulent ones. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for law enforcement agencies to intensify efforts to prevent and mitigate such secondary scams.

3) **Actions to Be Taken:**
Awareness campaigns can be instrumental in educating the public about the risks of fraudulent cryptocurrency recovery services. County IT departments may consider disseminating this information via social media, public bulletins, and other outreach programs. Additionally, the county could strengthen its cybersecurity protocols to detect and mitigate scams targeting its residents. Collaboration with state and federal agencies, like the FBI, to share data and best practices can enhance the capability to protect citizens. Furthermore, encouraging residents to report suspected scams to the IC3 portal could aid law enforcement in tracking and prosecuting these fraudsters.
