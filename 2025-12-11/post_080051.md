**What happened:**  
The cybersecurity landscape for manufacturers experienced a significant threat with the attack on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which originated from the supply chain involving compromised credentials of third-party contractors. This breach halted production for weeks and had a severe economic impact, highlighting the potential devastation of supply chain vulnerabilities. The focus has been placed on securing the software development life cycle (SSDLC) to prevent such supply chain attacks, requiring manufacturers to enforce secure practices across their development and procurement processes.

**Why it matters:**  
The JLR breach underscores the critical vulnerabilities within manufacturing supply chains, particularly from software development and third-party dependencies. Such vulnerabilities can lead to substantial operational and economic disruptions, as seen in the JLR case, negatively impacting employment and requiring governmental intervention. The incident highlights the necessity for manufacturers to prioritize SSDLC practices to mitigate risks, maintain continuity, and protect the integrity of their operations, signaling a shift from traditional infrastructure-focused security to comprehensive lifecycle security strategies.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Manufacturers should enhance their procurement evaluations by incorporating SSDLC criteria, ensuring vendors adhere to secure development practices. They should demand concrete evidence of security credentials like IEC 62443-4-1 certification and maintain continuous evaluation of partner maturity in cybersecurity. This involves demanding structured evidence such as auditor reports and SBOM records. Such proactive measures in the procurement process, along with emphasizing security throughout the software development lifecycle, will help prevent the propagation of vulnerabilities in supply chains and protect manufacturing operations from similar cybersecurity threats.
