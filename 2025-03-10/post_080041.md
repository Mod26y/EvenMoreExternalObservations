1) What happened: Spanish researchers found undocumented commands in the ESP32 microchip, used widely in IoT devices for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. These commands enable potential attacks, such as spoofing trusted devices, unauthorized data access, and establishing long-term persistence. The ESP32, made by Espressif, impacts over one billion devices, highlighting a significant security risk. These commands were discovered using a new tool that accesses Bluetooth traffic at a low level.

2) Why it matters: The discovery reveals serious vulnerabilities in one of the most commonly used microchips for IoT devices, which are integral to numerous critical systems like medical equipment, smart locks, and mobile devices. These vulnerabilities could be exploited for impersonation attacks and could allow attackers to gain control over devices, posing significant risks to user privacy and security. Given the widespread use of the chip, even a small percentage of exploited devices could lead to substantial security incidents.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations using ESP32 in their IoT devices should assess the risk posed by these commands and work with Espressif to understand possible mitigations. They should consider conducting audits of their devices to determine exposure and prepare potential firmware updates when patches are available. Additionally, there should be increased scrutiny in their supply chain to prevent malicious firmware updates or rogue Bluetooth connections. Organizations might also invest in additional security tools to monitor and respond to suspicious Bluetooth activities promptly.
