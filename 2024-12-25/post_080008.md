1) What happened: A new Mirai-based botnet campaign is targeting network video recorders and TP-Link routers, exploiting a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in DigiEver DS-2105 Pro NVRs, among others. The botnet leverages outdated firmware, primarily on devices with documented, unpatched vulnerabilities like CVE-2023-1389 and CVE-2018-17532. Attackers inject commands by exploiting flawed input validation, converting devices into botnet nodes for DDoS attacks and further compromise.

2) Why it matters: This botnet poses significant risks as it harnesses compromised devices to launch distributed denial of service attacks, potentially disrupting critical network services. Its sophisticated encryption methods and support for various processors demonstrate evolving capabilities that could enable attackers to target a broader range of devices. Unpatched vulnerabilities in widely used network hardware expose numerous organizations to substantial operational threats and underscore the need for diligent vulnerability management.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should prioritize updating device firmware to mitigate vulnerabilities, particularly for DigiEver NVRs, TP-Link, and Teltonika routers. Implementing intrusion detection systems using the provided Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and Yara rules can help identify and block these threats. Network segmentation and enhanced access controls can reduce attack surfaces. It also serves as a timely reminder to regularly review and enforce strong security policies, ensuring that all network devices are routinely monitored for patches and vulnerabilities.
