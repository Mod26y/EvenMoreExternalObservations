Cellebrite, an Israeli digital forensics company, developed a zero-day exploit chain used by Serbian police to unlock an Android phone belonging to a student activist and attempt spyware installation. Amnesty International discovered this during a forensic examination and reported it, prompting Google to identify three vulnerabilities within Android's Linux kernel. Only one of these vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-53104, has been patched to date. Google's rapid response included sharing patches with OEM partners as they continue to address ongoing risks associated with unpatched vulnerabilities.

This situation highlights significant privacy and security concerns, particularly regarding the use of digital surveillance tools on human rights activists. The discovery of these exploits underscores the ongoing cat-and-mouse dynamic between software vendors and hackers or law enforcement exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. The situation also reveals potential geopolitical implications, as tech companies must navigate decisions about who can access their tools, affecting global user privacy and national security.

Organizations and individual users should promptly install security updates provided by Google or their device manufacturers. They might also disable USB debugging and switch to "Charge Only" mode to reduce risk when connecting devices to potentially untrusted sources physically. Moreover, entities with privacy concerns could consider using alternative operating systems like GrapheneOS that receive prompt security patches, especially for serious kernel-related vulnerabilities. Regular security awareness training will help maintain best practices, ensuring users stay informed about the risks of data extraction techniques and methods to mitigate them.
