Ransomware gangs have been exploiting a vulnerability in the Paragon Partition Manager's BioNTdrv.sys driver via "Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver" (BYOVD) attacks. This approach enables them to gain SYSTEM-level privileges on Windows devices, even if the Paragon software is not installed, by introducing the vulnerable driver themselves. While Microsoft has identified five flaws, ransomware groups have been leveraging CVE-2025-0289 as a zero-day to execute malicious code with elevated privileges. Both Paragon and Microsoft have released patches and updated protective measures like Microsoft's Vulnerable Driver Blocklist to counter these exploits.

This vulnerability is significant because it showcases attackers' growing use of BYOVD tactics, which sidestep traditional security mechanisms by abusing legitimate, signed drivers. Given the driverâ€™s kernel-level access, these attacks pose a substantial threat, allowing ransomware gangs to escalate privileges and potentially evade many forms of endpoint detection even if the attack vector doesn't rely on the Paragon software's presence. The widespread adoption of such tactics by multiple threat actor groups presents a prominent challenge in maintaining the security integrity of Windows systems across various organizations.

In response to this vulnerability, organizations should prioritize updating their Paragon Partition Manager to the latest version that patches these flaws. Additionally, enabling Microsoft's Vulnerable Driver Blocklist is recommended to prevent the vulnerable driver from being utilized in attacks. Regularly auditing security settings to ensure that this blocklist is active offers an added layer of defense. Beyond these immediate actions, a general emphasis on privilege management and endpoint protection strategies should be strengthened to mitigate broader risks associated with BYOVD attacks.
