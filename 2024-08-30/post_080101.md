### What happened
The state-backed Iranian threat group, Fox Kitten, is aiding ransomware actors in attacks focused on US and other international targets. The activity includes selling access to compromised networks across multiple sectors like finance, defense, healthcare, and education. The group is leveraging various vulnerabilities in VPN devices and other remote access products to break into networks. They are known to offer full domain control and domain admin credentials to other cyber actors, thereby facilitating ransomware attacks.

### Why it matters
The collaboration between Fox Kitten and ransomware operators escalates the risk and impact of cyberattacks on critical sectors. By granting high-level access to compromised networks, Fox Kitten not only enables ransomware deployments but also exacerbates the stolen data and business operations disruptions. Organizations could face severe financial losses, reputational damage, and legal ramifications. It also underscores the vulnerabilities in network security that many organizations still have not mitigated, posing persistent risks.

### What actions should be taken
Organizations should prioritize patching vulnerabilities in VPNs and other remote access devices, especially those identified as being targeted by Fox Kitten, like CVE-2019-19781 and CVE-2022-1388. Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to critical systems can offer an additional layer of security. Regularly updating and segmenting networks can contain breaches and limit lateral movement. Employing threat intelligence feeds to stay informed about emerging risks and conducting regular security audits can help in early detection and response to potential intrusions.
