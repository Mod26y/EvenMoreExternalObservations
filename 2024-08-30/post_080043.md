1. **What happened:**
The article reports that the Corona Mirai-based malware botnet is exploiting a 5-year-old remote code execution (RCE) zero-day vulnerability in AVTECH IP cameras. These cameras have been discontinued and reached their end-of-life (EoL) in 2019, meaning no patches or updates will be provided to address the flaw (CVE-2024-7029). Starting in March 2024, this exploit has been used in the wild to compromise these cameras, allowing attackers to execute commands and incorporate compromised devices into botnets for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

2. **Why it matters:**
This vulnerability has significant implications for organizations still using these outdated AVTECH IP cameras, as they are vulnerable to malicious attacks without any available security patches. The compromise of these devices not only jeopardizes their operational integrity but also poses a broader security risk as they can be co-opted into larger botnets used for DDoS attacks. This is especially concerning for critical sectors such as healthcare, transportation, finance, and public health, where these vulnerable cameras are often deployed and can serve as entry points for broader network attacks.

3. **Actions should be taken:**
Organizations utilizing AVTECH AVM1203 IP cameras should immediately take these devices offline and replace them with newer models that are actively supported and receive regular security updates. Additionally, all Internet-facing devices, especially IoT devices like IP cameras, should be configured with strong and unique passwords and segregated from critical or production networks. Practicing regular firmware updates for all network-connected devices ensures that vulnerabilities are patched, thereby reducing the risk of exploitations. Enhanced network monitoring and firewall rules can help detect and block malicious activity associated with known vulnerabilities.
