1) **What happened:**
The BlackCat ransomware attack compromised Change Healthcare due to several security shortcomings, including inadequate protection of its Citrix remote-access portal, lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA), and insufficient backup strategies. Notably, Change Healthcare lacked cyber insurance, resulting in a substantial financial burden on its parent company, UnitedHealth. The article emphasizes the growing importance of specific security measures like backups, MFA, and robust remote-access protections, as well as the benefits of cyber insurance in managing and mitigating the impact of ransomware and related cyber threats.

2) **Why it matters:**
This incident underscores the critical need for effective cybersecurity controls and the financial safety net provided by cyber insurance. The fact that attacks are increasing in frequency and severity, as evidenced by the record number of ransomware victims, highlights the vulnerability of businesses. Without proper security measures and insurance, companies face significant risks, including profound financial losses and operational disruptions. The article also points to the broader industry trend of relying on certain security technologies to lower premiums, thus aligning financial incentives with robust security practices.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
Organizations should evaluate and enhance their cybersecurity posture by implementing multi-factor authentication, securing remote-access systems, and establishing comprehensive backup strategies. Additionally, they should consider acquiring cyber insurance to mitigate potential financial losses and benefit from insurers' insights into optimal security measures. Regularly analyzing and updating security protocols to address evolving threats can prevent incidents and reduce recovery costs. Adopting managed detection and response (MDR) solutions may also be a prudent investment to detect and mitigate threats before they cause significant damage.
