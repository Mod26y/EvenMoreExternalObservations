1) Microsoft has announced that Microsoft Publisher will no longer be supported after October 2026, and will be removed from Microsoft 365. This marks the end of support for various versions of Publisher, spanning from Publisher 2007 to 2021, and includes the Developer versions from 2010 and 2013. As a result, Microsoft has recommended converting existing Publisher files into PDF or Word formats and listed alternatives such as Word, PowerPoint, and Designer for different types of layout projects. Publisher will continue to be usable in its Perpetual version, but without updates or support.

2) This deprecation matters because it signals a forthcoming need for users and organizations that rely on Microsoft Publisher to transition their projects and workflows. Publisher has been a favored tool for creating visually appealing print materials in sectors like education, small businesses, and nonprofits. As some users may lack the technical expertise to easily switch or convert files, it underscores the importance of awareness and migration planning. Continuing to use unsupported software post-2026 also poses security risks due to the lack of updates and technical assistance.

3) Organizations should evaluate their dependency on Microsoft Publisher and initiate a transition plan to alternative software solutions, such as Word, PowerPoint, or third-party design tools like Canva or Adobe InDesign. It would be prudent to start converting existing .pub files to supported formats using macros for efficiency. Additionally, training sessions to familiarize staff with alternative tools might be necessary. Organizations should also consider the potential security implications of using unsupported software and prioritize securing any data and projects currently reliant on Publisher before deprecation.
