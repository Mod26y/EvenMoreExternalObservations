Switzerland's National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC) has implemented a new rule mandating that critical infrastructure organizations report cyberattacks within 24 hours. This change goes into effect on April 1, 2025, in response to the rising incidence and impact of cyber incidents on national infrastructure. Critical sectors including utilities, local governments, and transport organizations are affected. The law enforces penalties for non-compliance post-October 1, 2025, with fines reaching up to CHF 100,000 ($114,000). Initial reports should be filed promptly using an NCSC online form or email, without the need for registration, and followed up by more detailed reports within 14 days.

This requirement is significant as it enhances Switzerland's overall cybersecurity resiliency and aligns with the European Union's NIS Directive. By mandating rapid reporting, authorities can quickly collaborate and mobilize resources to mitigate the effects of cyberattacks, protecting essential services and sensitive data from potential threats. As cyberattacks become more advanced, real-time knowledge sharing between crucial services and national cybersecurity bodies may help prevent widespread disruption and increase the effectiveness of national defense mechanisms against cyber threats.

To adapt to this rule, organizations in critical sectors might evaluate their current incident response strategies to ensure rapid detection and reporting capabilities. They can benefit from investing in awareness and training programs for staff to recognize potential security incidents promptly. Developing automated systems to facilitate quick reporting to NCSC can also enhance compliance. Furthermore, staying informed about exemption clauses under Art. 74c might grant strategic flexibility in reporting. Regular testing and updating of incident response plans could be key in ensuring that 24-hour reporting becomes a sustainable practice.
