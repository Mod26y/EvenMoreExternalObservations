1) From the article's title and source, it's deduced the focus is on Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) microburstsâ€”brief, intense bursts of traffic aimed at overwhelming networks or services. Such attacks leverage short-duration spikes to evade detection and mitigation systems set for longer-duration threats. They result in service outages or degradation, impacting user experience and organizational reputation.

2) Understanding DDoS microbursts matters because traditional defenses often miss them due to their brevity. As organizations become increasingly digital, downtime can lead to significant operational and financial repercussions. Protecting against these unique threats is crucial for maintaining service reliability and guarding organizational assets.

3) Organizations should consider augmenting their existing DDoS defenses with solutions specifically designed to detect and respond to microbursts. This might involve leveraging advanced analytics and adaptive rate-limiting techniques. Regularly testing and updating incident response plans can also help ensure a timely and effective response. Collaborating with service providers that offer robust DDoS mitigation capabilities could provide additional resilience against these fast-acting attacks.
