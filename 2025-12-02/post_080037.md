The data breach at Coupang, affecting 33.7 million customers, resulted in the unauthorized access to personal details such as full names, phone numbers, and addresses. The breach was discovered months after it occurred, and despite investigations, the exposure of sensitive customer data remains significant. While financial information was reportedly safeguarded, the lapse in monitoring and immediate response allowed extensive customer information to be compromised.

This breach highlights the criticality of robust internal controls and real-time monitoring systems to prevent unauthorized access, particularly from insiders. The incident raises concerns about data handling and cybersecurity practices, as well as the potential for phishing and identity theft against exposed customers, risking privacy and trust in digital commerce platforms.

Coupang should bolster its internal security measures, particularly around identity and access management (IAM), ensuring that access privileges are promptly updated and reviewed. Implementing advanced monitoring tools to detect anomalous activities and enhancing employee training on data protection can mitigate future risks. Customers should be advised on recognizing phishing attempts and securing personal data, stressing ongoing vigilance given the scope of this breach.
