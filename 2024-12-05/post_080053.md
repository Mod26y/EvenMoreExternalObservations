Onapsis announced an enhancement to its Control product line, introducing a new bundle to advance security testing for SAP's Business Technology Platform (BTP). This enhancement allows automated code scanning within popular development environments and Git repositories, aiming to improve security during application development for SAP BTP projects. The offering aids in early detection and mitigation of code vulnerabilities, pivotal as organizations amplify cloud adoption and use SAP BTP for application development.

This development holds significance given the surge in cloud adoption and the importance of securing applications built on SAP BTP. With SAP's cloud revenue continually rising, organizations need robust security measures embedded within their development processes to protect against vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and unexpected project delays. Onapsisâ€™ new capabilities ensure continuous security validation throughout the development lifecycle, offering peace of mind to businesses migrating to or operating within SAP's cloud environments.

In response to this development, organizations utilizing SAP BTP should consider integrating Onapsis' application security capabilities into their development processes. Doing so can streamline security checks and preemptively address vulnerabilities. It's advisable for development and QA teams to undergo training on using these enhanced tools effectively, ensuring that security becomes a seamless part of their workflow. Consideration should also be given to assessing the security framework for SAP projects and adjusting it accordingly to incorporate these new technological capabilities.
