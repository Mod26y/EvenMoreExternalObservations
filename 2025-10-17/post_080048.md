### What Happened?
Hackers exploited a recently patched remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-20352) in older Cisco networking devices to deploy a Linux rootkit, thereby gaining persistent access. This vulnerability affects Ciscoâ€™s Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in IOS and IOS XE operating systems. Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro discovered that these attacks, termed 'Operation Zero Disco,' targeted Cisco 9400, 9300, and legacy 3750G series devices without endpoint detection solutions. Additionally, attempts were made to exploit an older vulnerability (CVE-2017-3881), and the deployed rootkit includes features like bypassing logs and internal firewalls, and facilitating lateral movement across networks.

### Why It Matters?
The exploitation of this vulnerability highlights critical security gaps in legacy Cisco hardware widely used in enterprise and government networks, potentially compromising sensitive data and operational security. Persistent attacks on even newer devices underscore the continued threat to network infrastructure despite advanced security measures. Attackers gaining root-level access through these vulnerabilities can disrupt operations, conduct data exfiltration, and use compromised devices as launch pads for further attacks. This underlines the need for robust security practices and the potential consequences of not updating or adequately securing network equipment.

### What Actions Should Be Taken?
Organizations should immediately assess their network infrastructure, ensuring all Cisco devices are patched to the latest security updates. Advanced monitoring solutions and endpoint detection response (EDR) tools should be employed to detect suspicious activities and unauthorized access. Conducting low-level firmware and ROM investigations on suspect devices can help uncover compromises. Regular security audits, awareness training on the importance of timely updates, and reviewing architecture to replace outdated equipment with modern, more secure models are pivotal steps in fortifying the network against such sophisticated attacks.
