**What happened:** While the content of the specific article is inaccessible due to a 403 error, the title and URL imply a focus on implementing Secure by Design principles for Artificial Intelligence (AI). This likely involves integrating security measures throughout the development lifecycle of AI systems to mitigate potential vulnerabilities, ensuring AI systems are robust against threats.

**Why it matters:** Secure by Design principles are crucial as AI systems handle sensitive data and can influence critical decisions. Vulnerabilities in AI can lead to data breaches, manipulation, or compromise in system integrity. Ensuring AI systems are secure from the ground up helps protect against exploitation and maintains stakeholder trust in AI technologies.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations developing or utilizing AI should prioritize embedding security throughout the design and development phases. This includes conducting regular threat assessments, integrating security testing tools, and ensuring transparency in AI systems. Additionally, staying informed about best practices and potential threats in AI security can further enhance an organization's protective measures against cybersecurity risks.
