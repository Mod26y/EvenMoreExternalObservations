The Windows 10 KB5058481 update is a non-security, optional cumulative update preview that introduces several changes and enhancements to Windows 10 22H2. Notably, it restores the display of seconds in the calendar flyout on the taskbar, a feature many users desired. The update also includes updates to the Rich Calendar feature and fixes issues related to rendering certain characters and syncing accounts in European markets. However, a known issue includes blurry NOTO fonts in certain conditions, with a workaround provided. This preview allows administrators to evaluate changes that will be formally integrated in upcoming Patch Tuesday updates.

This update matters as it reflects ongoing improvements to user interface elements, which can influence user experience. The restoration of seconds to the clock might cater to specific professional needs where precise timekeeping is essential. Moreover, addressing font rendering issues can impact readability and user satisfaction, especially for non-English users. Even without security patches, evaluating these optional updates allows organizations to stay prepared for future updates, ensuring compatibility and understanding changes before they become mandatory.

Organizations should assess the update in a test environment, particularly if the restored features or fixes address known issues in their environment. Evaluating updates in advance can ease the integration of these changes into main systems. They may also consider the workaround for the font issue if it affects their workforce. Although updating is optional, regularly checking for such previews can keep systems aligned with Microsoft's planned changes, reducing unforeseen impacts during formal Patch Tuesdays.
