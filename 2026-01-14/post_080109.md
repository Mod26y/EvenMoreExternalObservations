1) The article likely discusses the challenges organizations face due to high turnover rates among Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs). A succession crisis occurs when there are not enough qualified candidates ready to step into these critical roles, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. This turnover can cause leadership gaps and disrupt continuity in information security strategies, weakening an organization's overall cybersecurity posture.

2) This issue matters because CISOs are crucial in shaping and executing an organization’s cybersecurity strategy. High turnover rates can lead to a lack of long-term vision, increased vulnerability to cyber threats, and difficulty in maintaining consistent security measures, thus potentially increasing the risk of data breaches and other cyber incidents.

3) Organizations could focus on developing comprehensive succession plans and investing in leadership development within their cybersecurity teams. They might benefit from cross-training IT personnel to ensure a pool of potential candidates is prepared to fill CISO roles when turnovers occur. Additionally, they could consider improving retention strategies by fostering a supportive work environment and providing competitive benefits to mitigate frequent leadership changes.
