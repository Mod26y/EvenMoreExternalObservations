1) The cyberattack on Belgian hospital AZ Monica required the hospital to shut down all servers, leading to the cancellation of scheduled procedures and transferring of critical patients. The shutdown affected campuses in Antwerp and Deurne, significantly hampering hospital operations, with the emergency department operating at reduced capacity and other critical services offline. While urgent care continued, non-urgent consultations were postponed due to inaccessible digital medical records. Authorities have been notified, and an investigation is underway, hinting at a possible ransom demand, although this remains unconfirmed.

2) This incident highlights the vulnerability of healthcare institutions to cyberattacks that disrupt critical healthcare services and pose risks to patient safety. Healthcare facilities are attractive targets for attackers due to their reliance on digital systems for patient data management and the potentially dire consequences of system shutdowns. The attack spotlighting potential ransomware involvement signifies a growing cybersecurity threat in the healthcare sector, emphasizing the need for enhanced security measures to protect sensitive patient information and ensure continuity of care during emergencies.

3) In response to such cybersecurity threats, healthcare institutions should enhance their networks' security posture by conducting regular risk assessments and implementing robust incident response plans. Investing in cybersecurity training for staff can mitigate risks and improve awareness regarding potential threats. Additionally, employing comprehensive backup systems and maintaining offline copies of sensitive data will ensure vital operations can continue during system outages. Collaborating with cybersecurity experts for ongoing threat intelligence and proactive monitoring can help detect and thwart potential attacks before they compromise critical infrastructure.
