Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-rolls-out-new-secure-boot-certificates-for-windows-devices/

**1) What Happened:**  
Microsoft announced it is rolling out new Secure Boot certificates for Windows 11 systems (version 24H2 and 25H2) automatically to replace those set to expire in June 2026. Secure Boot is crucial for blocking unauthorized software during system startup by verifying digital signatures against trusted certificates within UEFI firmware. The phased update is being pushed to devices that show successful update signals to ensure security without sudden disruptions. IT professionals are advised to ensure their systems receive these updates to maintain Secure Boot’s functionality and security.

**2) Why It Matters:**  
This update is significant because failing to renew Secure Boot certificates could unsettle Secure Boot protections, leaving systems vulnerable to rootkit malware and other unauthorized executions during startup. By continually verifying bootloaders' integrity, Secure Boot is a fundamental piece of defending against early-stage attacks on Windows systems. The automatic update strategy aims for seamless administration, but involvement from IT admins remains crucial to preclude a lapse in security protections, critical for maintaining operational trust and regulatory compliance.

**3) What Actions Should Be Taken:**  
IT administrators are encouraged to verify the Secure Boot status on all managed devices using PowerShell commands or registry keys. Following this, they should apply any available manufacturer firmware updates before integrating the Microsoft's new certificates. For environments where manual action is necessary, administrators can deploy certificates using registry keys, the Windows Configuration System (WinCS), or Group Policy settings. An inventory of devices and a meticulous update approach could assure continuity and safeguard against potential security incidents upon certificate expiry.
