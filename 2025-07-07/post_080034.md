1) **What happened:** OpenAI is developing a new feature called "Study together" for ChatGPT, which aims to assist students in exam preparation. While the feature is not functioning yet, it is anticipated to enable collaborative study sessions through ChatGPT, either by inviting friends or using the AI as a study partner. This potential educational tool is part of broader enhancements in ChatGPT, including new connectors like Slack integration for deep research capabilities. These developments are in line with OpenAI's ongoing advancements, amid broader operational challenges.

2) **Why it matters:** This feature represents a significant shift in how AI can influence educational methodologies, potentially redefining study habits and accessibility to learning resources. It could provide students with an interactive learning aid, enhancing digital education's interactivity. However, it also raises data privacy concerns, especially if educational data and personal interactions are to be processed by AI. Institutions must evaluate the implications of AI in education, considering both opportunities and cybersecurity risks.

3) **What actions should be taken:** Entities engaging with ChatGPT, particularly educational institutions, should monitor the development of this feature closely. Conducting thorough risk assessments is advisable to understand the potential privacy implications of allowing AI to engage in study sessions or access platforms like Slack. Institutions could start preparing data protection measures and regulatory compliance frameworks to ensure any deployment of such technology aligns with applicable laws and standards, minimizing exposure to potential data misuse or cybersecurity threats.
