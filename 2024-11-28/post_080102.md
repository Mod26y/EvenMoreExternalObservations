**What happened:** Operation Undercut is a malign influence campaign orchestrated by the Social Design Agency, a Russian entity. The campaign aims to undermine support for Ukraine abroad by disseminating AI-enhanced videos and impersonating legitimate media outlets on social media platforms like X. It targets audiences in the US, Ukraine, and Europe, aiming to manipulate perceptions of Ukraine's leadership and Western involvement. The operation extends to other geopolitical issues, including the Middle East and the 2024 US elections, using tactics like misinformation amplification and deepfake videos to influence public opinion and destabilize Western alliances.

**Why it matters:** Operation Undercut is significant because it showcases how malign actors are leveraging advanced technologies, such as AI and social media, to influence public opinion and destabilize geopolitical relations. The campaign’s apparent aim to alter Western foreign policy and reduce military support for Ukraine could have real political and humanitarian implications. By targeting multiple geopolitical fronts, including the 2024 US elections, these activities could exacerbate existing political divides, erode trust in legitimate media channels, and compromise democratic processes in targeted regions, potentially affecting international stability.

**What actions should be taken:** To counteract the effects of Operation Undercut, stakeholders should enhance monitoring and detection mechanisms for AI-generated content and social media misinformation. Collaborative efforts between governments, tech companies, and cybersecurity firms can be instrumental in identifying and disrupting such influence campaigns. Public awareness campaigns can educate users on recognizing and reporting disinformation. Encouraging media literacy and critical evaluation of information sources among the public will help mitigate the campaign’s impact. Finally, cybersecurity strategies should include a focus on securing election infrastructure and safeguarding against foreign interference.
