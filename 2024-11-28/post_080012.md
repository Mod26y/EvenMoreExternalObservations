1) What happened: Microsoft re-released security updates for Exchange Server for November 2024 after resolving email delivery issues. Initially, these updates were pulled from distribution due to problems reported by administrators, particularly affecting servers using custom mail flow rules or data loss protection rules. Microsoft provided instructions for administrators regarding the deployment of the revised update, Nov 2024 SUv2, tailored to different scenarios such as prior manual or automatic installations and rollbacks.

2) Why it matters: Ensuring the integrity and reliability of email systems is critical for organizational communication and operations. The initial issues with the November 2024 security update disrupted email flow, posing a risk to business continuity and data protection policies. Re-releasing the update addresses these disruptions while enhancing security measures against high-severity vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-49040, which enables more effective detection and mitigation of certain email spoofing attacks.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations using Exchange Server 2016 and 2019 should assess their environment against Microsoft's recommendations and apply the re-released November 2024 SUv2 update according to their specific scenarios. Administrators should also routinely execute the Exchange Health Checker script post-update to identify potential configuration problems that could affect performance. Furthermore, enabling the "secure by default" settings can help in identifying and warning against potential email threats, thus bolstering the organizationâ€™s email security posture.
