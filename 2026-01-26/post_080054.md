**What happened?**

In late December 2025, a cyberattack on Poland’s power grid was attributed to Sandworm, a hacking group linked to Russian intelligence. The attackers attempted to deploy a new data-wiping malware named DynoWiper. The attack targeted two combined heat and power plants and a system managing renewable energy sources. While the technical details of DynoWiper remain sparse, it is known to delete files and render operating systems unusable. Sandworm is notorious for similar attacks, including a major strike on Ukraine's energy infrastructure a decade ago.

**Why it matters?**

The attempted attack on Poland’s energy systems highlights the persistent threat of state-sponsored cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure, which poses significant risks to national security and public safety. As energy grids play a crucial role in a country's functioning, any disruption can have dire consequences. The involvement of Sandworm, known for previous successful attacks, emphasizes the advanced capabilities of state-backed hacking groups and their potential impact on geopolitical stability and international relations.

**What actions should be taken?**

Energy sector organizations, particularly those controlling critical infrastructure, should enhance their cybersecurity measures, including monitoring for signs of unauthorized access and reviewing incident response plans. Collaboration with international cybersecurity entities and sharing threat intelligence can help in identifying tactics used by groups like Sandworm. Employing advanced monitoring tools and ensuring system backups are current and secure can mitigate potential damage. Finally, continuous employee training on recognizing phishing and social engineering attempts helps create a first line of defense against such intrusions.
