Microsoft is currently dealing with an issue where certain Windows 11 devices are experiencing boot failures, presenting "UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME" errors after receiving the January 2026 Patch Tuesday security updates. Specifically, the problem affects devices running Windows 11 version 25H2 and all editions of version 24H2 following the installation of the KB5074109 cumulative update. The affected systems cannot boot into Windows, displaying an error message requiring a manual recovery to proceed.
