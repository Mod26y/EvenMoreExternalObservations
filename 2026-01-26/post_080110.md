1) What happened:

The article titled "Swipe, Plug-in, Pwned: Researchers Find New Ways to Hack Vehicles" likely discusses new vulnerabilities discovered by researchers in vehicle systems. Although the specifics are inaccessible, typical automotive hacking involves exploiting weak software protocols, unsecured wireless communications, or exposed physical interfaces in vehicles. These vulnerabilities may provide hackers unauthorized access to control vehicle functions, steal sensitive data, or compromise user safety. 

2) Why it matters:

The potential for hacking vehicles introduces significant risks to both individual and public safety. Vehicles are increasingly connected, relying on embedded systems and network communications that, if exploited, could lead to dangerous situations such as loss of control or data breaches. It impacts consumer trust and highlights the need for robust security measures in automotive design and technology, as these breaches could also cripple critical transportation infrastructure and systems that communities rely on.

3) What actions should be taken:

In response to such vulnerabilities, automakers and technology providers should prioritize the integration of strong cybersecurity measures in vehicle design, including regular software updates and rigorous security testing. Engaging in collaboration with cybersecurity researchers can provide insights for patching vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Consumers should be educated about potential risks and encouraged to maintain up-to-date security patches for their vehicle systems. Government and industry bodies may benefit from establishing standards and regulations to ensure the security of automotive technologies.
