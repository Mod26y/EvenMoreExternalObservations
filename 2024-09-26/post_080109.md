### What Happened
At the Pwn2Own Automotive contest in Tokyo scheduled for 2025, hackers will compete to discover vulnerabilities in four categories: Tesla, in-vehicle infotainment (IVI), electric vehicle chargers, and operating systems. The competition offers over $1 million in prizes, with the highest bounty of $500,000 awarded for compromising Tesla’s Autopilot system in a "full remote with unconfined root" mode. The contest format involves participants accumulating points for successful exploits, and the highest-scoring individual earns the "Master of Pwn" title and elevated privileges for subsequent contests.

### Why It Matters
This contest highlights the evolving and increasing vulnerabilities in automotive technology, which are becoming more integrated into daily life. The substantial rewards reflect the severity and potential real-world impact of such exploits, particularly with regards to safety-critical systems like Tesla’s Autopilot. The event underscores the urgent need for robust security measures within the automotive industry as technologies advance and vehicles become more interconnected. It also underscores the importance of proactive security through initiatives like Pwn2Own, which encourages ethical hacking to uncover and address these vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.

### What Actions Should Be Taken
Information security steering committees within the county should consider collaborating with automotive industry experts and ethical hacking communities to stay abreast of these developments. Regularly updating security protocols for county-owned vehicles, particularly those with advanced digital features, becomes critical. Encouraging local businesses involved in automotive technology to participate in or observe contests like Pwn2Own can help foster a more secure technological environment. Lastly, committees should emphasize robust incident response plans to quickly address potential vulnerabilities exposed through such hacking contests.
