**1) What happened:**

Hackers are targeting industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) devices within critical infrastructure networks, employing unsophisticated methods such as brute force attacks and exploiting default credentials. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) specifically pointed out the impact on water and wastewater systems (WWS), where these attacks could lead to significant disruptions. The attacks have been ongoing since 2022 and have recently expanded to include more North American and European targets.

**2) Why it matters:**

The targeting of critical infrastructure is particularly concerning because of the vital services these systems provide, such as water treatment and distribution. Breaches could lead to service interruptions, safety hazards, and significant operational disruptions. The use of simple attack vectors like default credentials highlights a prevalent security gap, indicating that many systems are insufficiently protected. This underlines the urgency for enhanced security measures, given the potential for harm and service outages, which could destabilize essential public services.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations operating OT and ICS devices should prioritize changing default passwords and enabling multifactor authentication to mitigate these simple attack methods. Deploying firewalls to protect human-machine interfaces (HMIs) and hardening VNC installs are recommended steps. Additionally, regular updates and patches should be applied to all systems to bolster security against vulnerabilities. Itâ€™s also beneficial for organizations to review and implement best practices and guidelines, such as those provided in the recent advisories, to strengthen their cybersecurity posture against these and future threats.
