**1) What happened?**

Meta has terminated its direct peering relationship with Deutsche Telekom after the Regional Court of Cologne's ruling required Meta to pay €20 million to keep using the telecom network. Subsequently, Meta has rerouted its internet traffic for its platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) through third-party providers. This break from direct routing is precipitated by disagreements over peering fees, where Deutsche Telekom began demanding payment for data traffic that was previously exchanged without charges under a settlement-free model.

**2) Why it matters?**

This development holds significant implications for network performance and broader net neutrality debates. Deutsche Telekom subscribers are likely to experience increased latency, congestion, and potential service disruptions on Meta platforms, leading to a reduced user experience. Furthermore, the precedent set by Deutsche Telekom charging for data traffic from larger companies like Meta challenges the principles of net neutrality, which advocate for an open and equal internet. This conflict could influence global practices regarding settlement-free peering and the financial dynamics between content providers and internet service providers (ISPs).

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

The county’s information security steering committee should closely examine the impacts of these developments on local network performance, particularly if relying on services from Meta or Deutsche Telekom. Conducting a review of existing agreements with ISPs and ensuring that secondary routing plans are robust could mitigate potential service disruptions. Additionally, staying informed about legislative or regulatory changes regarding net neutrality and peering agreements can help prepare for similar conflicts. It may also be prudent to engage with service providers proactively to address any anticipated increases in network traffic and develop strategies to maintain optimal network performance and reliability.
