**What Happened:**

A third Ivanti vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024-7593, has been reported by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and added to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog. This high-severity vulnerability, with a score of 9.8, allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass the administrative panel of Ivanti's virtual traffic manager (vTM) and create admin accounts due to an incorrect implementation of an authentication algorithm in older versions. Though a patch was released in August, the exposure to exploitation remains uncertain.

**Why It Matters:**

The exploitation of this Ivanti vulnerability is significant because it can lead to unauthorized administrative access, potentially compromising critical infrastructure and services. Given that this is the third Ivanti-related security issue in a short period, it highlights a recurring risk associated with this vendor's products. Such vulnerabilities can result in severe disruptions, data breaches, and loss of sensitive information, posing substantial risks to both public and private sector entities relying on Ivanti's technologies.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**

Organizations using Ivanti vTM should prioritize upgrading to the latest patched versions (22.2R1, 22.3R3, 22.5R2, 22.6R2, and 22.7R2) immediately to mitigate this vulnerability. Security teams should review the current network to identify any potential compromises and implement monitoring for suspicious activities that might indicate attempted exploitation. Additionally, continuous vulnerability assessment and patch management processes should be enhanced to ensure timely and efficient remediation of discovered vulnerabilities in the future. Given the recurring nature of these issues, a broader evaluation of dependency on Ivanti products and alternative solutions might also be prudent.
