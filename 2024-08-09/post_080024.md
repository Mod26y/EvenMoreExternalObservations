1) **What happened:**
Microsoft announced that Exchange Server 2016 will reach its end of extended support on October 14, 2024. Administrators are encouraged to decommission Exchange 2016 and move to Exchange 2019, which supports in-place upgrades to Exchange SE. Extended support end dates typically mean that Microsoft will no longer provide security updates, patches, or customer support for the product. The article highlights the necessity of transitioning to Exchange 2019 to ensure continued security and functionality and offers guidance for admins on how to manage migration effectively, including placing servers in maintenance mode and planning migrations within a controlled change window.

2) **Why it matters:**
End-of-support transitions are critical because unsupported software can become a significant security risk. Once support ends, vulnerabilities will not be patched, leaving systems exposed to potential exploits and attacks. For organizations still using Exchange 2016, this means a pressing need to migrate to Exchange 2019 or an alternative, such as Exchange Online, to continue receiving security updates and support. Failure to act could result in system breaches, data loss, and regulatory non-compliance. Ensuring that migrations are handled properly will prevent disruptions and maintain the integrity of the organization's mail infrastructure.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
Organizations using Exchange 2016 should develop a decommissioning and migration plan to transition to Exchange 2019 or a hosted solution like Exchange Online promptly. The plan should involve putting Exchange 2016 servers into maintenance mode, monitoring for and resolving any unforeseen issues, and carrying out the actual migration in a scheduled change control window. Reviewing and updating any connectivity or messaging logs will be essential to ensure a seamless transition. Additionally, organizations should stay informed of Microsoft's documentation and use available resources to guide their migration process effectively. Leveraging IT staff training and planning for adequate testing periods can further safeguard against potential issues.
