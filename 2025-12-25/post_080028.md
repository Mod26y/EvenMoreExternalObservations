1) What happened: Microsoft has announced a new Teams feature, launching in January 2026, allowing security administrators to block external users from contacting their organization’s members. This feature integrates Microsoft Teams with Defender for Office 365 and utilizes the Tenant Allow/Block List within the Defender portal. It lets admins manage blocked external users and domains through a centralized system accessible via the Defender XDR web portal. Before usage, organizations need to enable specific settings in the Teams admin center.

2) Why it matters: This update bolsters security by granting organizations more control over external communications, crucial in preventing social engineering attacks, such as those from cybercrime and ransomware gangs. By providing enhanced visibility and management of external contacts, organizations can mitigate potential security breaches. This development is important given the widespread use of Teams, with over 320 million monthly users, emphasizing the need for robust communication security measures.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should prepare by assessing their current Teams configurations and planning to enable necessary settings once the feature becomes available in January 2026. Security teams should also educate staff on new protocols and adjust security policies to integrate this blocking capability. Additionally, exploring the additional security features announced, such as malicious URL detection and file type protection, can further enhance threat detection and response strategies within their Teams environment.
