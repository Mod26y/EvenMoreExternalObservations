**1) What happened?**  
OpenAI is developing a new feature for ChatGPT called "Skills," which is similar to the existing "Skills" for Claude AI by Anthropic. This new feature will enhance ChatGPT by providing it with folder-based instructions that teach specific abilities, workflows, and domain-specific knowledge. These Skills are designed to be composable, portable, efficient, and powerful, enabling a more tailored and functional interaction. They will be accessible through slash commands, an editor, and an option for converting a custom GPT into a skill. The anticipated rollout for this feature is projected for January 2026. 

**2) Why it matters?**  
The introduction of Skills for ChatGPT marks a significant enhancement in AI's ability to handle domain-specific tasks, which could greatly benefit industries reliant on AI for specific applications. By making Skills portable and efficient, OpenAI might broaden the adaptation for workflows that require customized solutions. For cybersecurity, such advancements are critical as they can automate complex responses and enhance the capability of AI tools to respond to security incidents with precision. This can lead to improvements in efficiency, response time, and resource management in protecting sensitive data.

**3) What actions should be taken?**  
Organizations should monitor the development and release of ChatGPT's Skills to understand how they can be integrated into their operations for enhanced AI-driven solutions. It's advisable to assess potential applications within their business processes that could benefit from specialized Skills, particularly in areas requiring automation and domain-specific workflows. Keeping abreast of these advancements allows companies, especially in cybersecurity, to remain competitive and enhance their security posture by leveraging AI tools tailored to their specific needs. Additionally, planning for staff to receive training on these new features upon release could expedite their effective implementation.
