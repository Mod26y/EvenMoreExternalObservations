1) The article's title suggests a call for Congress to focus more on cyber threats rather than competition. This indicates that significant cybersecurity threats are being deprioritized in favor of legislative agendas addressing market competition. While the full content of the article is unavailable, the implication is clear: cybersecurity, a critical aspect of national security and public safety, is potentially being overshadowed by other concerns in the legislative realm.

2) This focus on cybersecurity matters because it highlights a potential gap in national defense strategy. Cyber threats can destabilize critical infrastructure, breach sensitive information, and disrupt economic stability. If legislative bodies do not prioritize these threats, the nation becomes vulnerable to escalating cyberattacks, thus emphasizing the need for a dedicated and robust cybersecurity strategy.

3) As a result of this information, local government entities might consider actively advocating for federal focus on cybersecurity measures. Collaboration can be enhanced between county IT departments and federal cybersecurity agencies to ensure preparedness. Additionally, steering committees could develop strategic plans emphasizing robust defense protocols, incident response strategies, and partnerships with cybersecurity experts to mitigate potential risks, thereby compensating for any national-level legislative oversight.
