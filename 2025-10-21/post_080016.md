**What happened?**

The DNS0.EU non-profit public DNS service, aimed at providing secure and privacy-focused DNS resolution for European users, has shut down due to sustainability challenges, largely from time and resource constraints. Started in 2023 with French origins, DNS0.EU offered a no-logs policy, robust encryption, and defense against malicious domains. The service was distributed across 62 servers in the EU. With its discontinuation, the team behind DNS0.EU recommended two alternatives: DNS4EU, a privacy-focused resolver by ENISA, and NextDNS, which offers more granular filtering options, both designed to maintain user security and privacy controls.

**Why it matters?**

The shutdown of DNS0.EU matters because it affects users who relied on its privacy-focused and GDPR-compliant services for secure internet navigation, especially in a digital age where data privacy and security are paramount. Such services protect against eavesdropping, phishing sites, and malicious command-and-control servers, contributing to safer browsing experiences. The discontinuation may increase user reliance on other DNS services which may not have similarly stringent privacy guarantees, thereby affecting the overall cybersecurity landscape. It highlights the challenges non-profit initiatives face in sustaining complex infrastructure amidst rising demand for secure internet services.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Organizations and individual users who relied on DNS0.EU should switch to alternative DNS services that align with their privacy and security needs, such as DNS4EU or NextDNS, following the closure announcement. Moreover, cybersecurity teams should re-evaluate their DNS settings and vendor dependencies to ensure ongoing security and compliance with regulations like GDPR. Authorities and stakeholders in privacy-focused initiatives may consider examining how to provide stable support and funding for essential public internet services to avoid similar shutdowns in the future. Regular reviews of DNS service providers for evolving cybersecurity threats and features can also be beneficial.
