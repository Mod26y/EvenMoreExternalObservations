**1) What happened:**

Muji, a major Japanese retail company, halted its online sales after a ransomware attack on its delivery partner, Askul. The attack caused a logistics disruption, impacting Mujiâ€™s ability to process online transactions, access order histories, and display certain web content through its digital platforms. While physical stores outside Japan were unaffected, the attack primarily impacted Muji's operations within Japan. Askul confirmed a ransomware infection and suspended orders and shipping operations while investigating the impact scope, including potential personal data leaks.

**2) Why it matters:**

The ransomware attack on Askul illustrates the critical vulnerability of supply chain partners and their significant impact on business operations. As a supplier, the disruption reverberated through Muji, a large corporation, demonstrating how dependent organizations can be on digital logistics capabilities. This incident also highlights the increasing frequency and sophistication of ransomware attacks on significant market players, which can cause substantial operational and financial repercussions. Ensuring the security of supply chain partners is essential to prevent widespread operational disruptions in interconnected business ecosystems.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should enhance their supply chain cybersecurity protocols by thoroughly vetting partners' cybersecurity practices and incorporating stronger contractual obligations regarding data protection. Conducting comprehensive risk assessments and cybersecurity audits of third-party vendors can identify potential vulnerabilities. Companies can further mitigate risks by establishing incident response plans and practicing regular simulations with partners to ensure preparedness. Enhancing data encryption, regular software updates, and robust employee training on recognizing phishing attempts are crucial defensive actions against ransomware threats. Implementing these measures can fortify organizations against similar disruptions.
