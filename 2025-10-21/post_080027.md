The recent issue involves Microsoft's October 2025 security updates, which have disabled USB mice and keyboards in the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). This renders the environment, used for repairing or troubleshooting the Windows operating system, ineffective due to the inability to perform necessary input actions. This problem affects both client and server platforms, including Windows 11 and Windows Server 2025. This situation highlights potential challenges for IT departments and users who may already be experiencing system issues requiring recovery tools, as they might find themselves unable to proceed without alternative input devices.

This issue is critical because WinRE is used extensively for system recovery and troubleshooting, especially during system failures where standard input devices are necessary for navigation. The unavailability of USB input controls could delay crucial system repairs and recovery actions, complicating the resolution process for users dealing with non-starting systems. This development highlights the ongoing importance of having robust, reliable recovery processes and tools that users can depend on in critical situations.

To address this issue, organizations might consider recommending temporary swaps to Bluetooth or PS/2 input devices until Microsoft provides a permanent fix. Additionally, updating recovery plans and inventorying compatible input devices could be beneficial to ensure service continuity during such disruptions. Organizations should also monitor Microsoft's updates closely, including advisory or patches that promise to resolve the input device issue in WinRE, to re-establish normal operational capacity as soon as possible.
