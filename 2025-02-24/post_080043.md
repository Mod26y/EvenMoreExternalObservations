Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-chrome-disables-ublock-origin-for-some-in-manifest-v3-rollout/

**1) What happened:**  
Google has started phasing out support for extensions based on Manifest V2, like uBlock Origin, in favor of Manifest V3 in the Chrome web browser. Manifest V3 is the latest specification aiming to improve extension performance and security by limiting their capabilities, particularly affecting ad blockers and privacy tools. As a result, some users are finding their uBlock Origin extensions automatically disabled, although the rollout is inconsistent, with some users unaffected. Google offers enterprises and specific users the option to retain Manifest V2 extensions until June 2025 through a special policy.

**2) Why it matters:**  
This transition affects the functionality of ad blockers and privacy-focused extensions which many users rely on for a secure and streamlined web browsing experience. The change introduces stricter limits, potentially impacting user privacy and control over online ads and tracking mechanisms. Organizations and individuals that depend heavily on these tools for cybersecurity need to adapt quickly to maintain their protection measures. The gradual shift to Manifest V3 highlights the constant evolution in digital security and privacy models, raising concerns over choice and effectiveness of tools available to end users.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**  
To prepare for and adapt to this change, users should begin exploring compatible extensions, like uBlock Origin Lite, which are built on Manifest V3. Organizations that rely on the advanced capabilities of older extensions might consider using Google's provision for continuing V2 use until 2025 if eligible. Additionally, cybersecurity teams should evaluate the security and functionality implications of Manifest V3 on existing systems and workflows, ensuring end-user guidance on transitioning to new tools or modifying browsing habits to maintain desired security and privacy levels.
