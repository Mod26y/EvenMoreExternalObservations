**What happened:**  
Nations are increasingly adopting the concept of 'data embassies' to secure national critical information. These data embassies are secure digital facilities located in foreign jurisdictions, ensuring that a country's important data remains accessible and protected even if the nation's infrastructure is compromised due to events like natural disasters or cyberattacks. This approach enhances the resilience of critical information systems by providing an offsite backup that can be operated independently of the nation's physical boundaries.

**Why it matters:**  
The establishment of data embassies is crucial in an era of escalating cyber threats and geopolitical tensions. With countries facing sophisticated cyberattacks and other forms of infrastructure threats, having data embassies ensures the continuity of government operations and services by safeguarding crucial data from potential disruptions. It implies a strategic shift towards considering national data as a sovereign asset that necessitates robust protection measures, thereby influencing global cybersecurity policies and international collaborations.

**What actions should be taken:**  
County information security steering committees can benefit from evaluating the feasibility of similar strategies on a local level. This entails analyzing critical data assets and potential threats to local infrastructure, and assessing whether establishing offsite data redundancies would improve resilience. Furthermore, fostering partnerships with private and public entities at various levels could provide secure data storage solutions. Awareness and training initiatives that emphasize the significance of data sovereignty and protection could also be prioritized to ensure a well-informed approach to future challenges.
