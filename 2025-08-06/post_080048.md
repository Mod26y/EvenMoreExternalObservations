Adobe recently issued emergency updates to address two critical zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Forms on JEE, following the disclosure of proof-of-concept exploits. The vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2025-54253 and CVE-2025-54254, allow for unauthenticated remote code execution and arbitrary file system read, respectively. These flaws, discovered by researchers from Searchlight Cyber, remained unpatched for over 90 days after initial disclosure. The publishment of a technical write-up detailing the exploitation process prompted Adobe to release patches.

These vulnerabilities are significant because they allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems, potentially leading to data breaches and system compromises. The critical nature of these flaws, with high severity CVSS scores, underscores the potential impact on organizations using AEM Forms, emphasizing the importance of prompt remediation to prevent exploitation.

As a result of these vulnerabilities, organizations using AEM Forms should prioritize the installation of the latest updates and hotfixes provided by Adobe to mitigate risk. Additionally, if immediate patching is not feasible, limiting access to the affected systems from the internet is advisable. Regularly reviewing system configurations and ensuring security best practices are followed can further enhance defense against such vulnerabilities.
