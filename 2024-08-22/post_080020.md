### What Happened

Hackers are leveraging progressive web applications (PWAs) to impersonate banking apps and steal credentials from Android and iOS users. These PWAs can be installed directly from a browser, mimicking native apps while evading traditional detection methods and installation restrictions. ESET has tracked campaigns targeting OTP Bank in Hungary and TBC Bank in Georgia, employing smishing and social media advertisements to lure victims into installing these malicious apps. The phishing apps then collect banking credentials and send them back to the attackers via distinct command and control infrastructures or Telegram.

### Why It Matters

This emerging trend of using PWAs for phishing is significant due to the ability of these apps to bypass traditional installation barriers and closely mimic legitimate applications, making detection difficult for users and security systems alike. As PWAs gain more traction for their cross-platform capabilities, this technique could be adopted by more cybercriminals, expanding the threat landscape. Given the lack of current safeguards from Google and Apple for PWAs/WebAPKs, this method could see a rise in sophisticated phishing attacks targeting broader demographics, underscoring the need for updated security measures.

### Actions to Take

The information security steering committee should consider several steps in light of these events. Firstly, awareness campaigns should be launched to educate users about the risks of installing apps from non-official sources, especially if prompted through unexpected messages or advertisements. Secondly, technical teams could implement additional monitoring mechanisms to identify and block malicious PWAs. Thirdly, partnerships with platform providers like Google and Apple should be pursued to advocate for stronger defenses against the misuse of PWAs. Lastly, ensure that incident response plans are updated to deal with the unique challenges posed by PWA phishing attacks.
