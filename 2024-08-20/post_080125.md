**1) What happened:**

IBM has introduced two new IBM SkillsBuild certificates focused on cybersecurity and data analytics, targeting the Alabama Community College System, Bay Area Community College Consortium, Colorado Community College System, and Louisiana Community and Technical College System. These certificates were developed through a public-private partnership involving community colleges and industry experts. The initiative emphasizes the reskilling of workers in response to automation and AI advancements. The courses are designed to provide hands-on, experiential learning and align with industry-standard certifications, thereby enhancing job prospects for graduates.

**2) Why it matters:**

This initiative addresses the critical skills gap in cybersecurity and data analytics, fields fundamental to AI innovation and secure data management. By integrating these certificates into community college curriculums, it democratizes access to high-demand skills and aligns educational outcomes with industry needs. With the rapid evolution of technology, particularly AI and automation, the workforce requires continuous upskilling. This initiative not only prepares students for immediate employment opportunities but also supports broader economic resilience and intellectual capital development, contributing to workforce readiness in a data-driven, AI-enabled landscape.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

The information security steering committee should consider establishing partnerships with local community colleges that adopt these IBM SkillsBuild programs. This could facilitate a pipeline of skilled graduates ready to fill cybersecurity and data analytics roles within the county's IT infrastructure. Additionally, they should explore opportunities to sponsor or support students in these programs through internships or collaborative projects. By doing so, the county could both strengthen its own cybersecurity posture and contribute to regional workforce development, ensuring a steady influx of qualified professionals to meet future challenges.
