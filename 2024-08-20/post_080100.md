**What Happened:**
The article reports a significant increase in cyberattacks targeting African businesses, which grew by 23% in 2023. Interpol identifies ransomware and business email compromise (BEC) as the most severe threats. Factors contributing to this rise include digital illiteracy, outdated infrastructure, and a lack of cybersecurity professionals. Despite the rapid economic growth, cybercrime poses a substantial risk, draining economic resources. The report calls for African nations to accelerate cybersecurity skills training and develop robust regulatory frameworks.

**Why It Matters:**
This situation is critical as it highlights the intersection between economic growth and rising cybercrime, which could stifle the economic progress of some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, such as those in Africa. The significant financial losses and instability induced by cybercrime can undermine confidence in the digital economy, waste valuable resources, and create an environment of general insecurity. African countries are increasingly integral to the global economy; thus, the impact of their cybersecurity vulnerabilities can have far-reaching consequences beyond the continent.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**
Given the reported vulnerabilities, it is advisable for African nations to prioritize cybersecurity education and workforce development. Establishing regional collaboration on cybersecurity standards and regulations could help in creating a unified defense strategy. Governments and private sectors should invest in modernizing cybersecurity infrastructure and enhancing public awareness about cybersecurity risks. Additionally, adopting emerging technologies like AI for threat detection and incident response could offer a significant advantage. Accurate and comprehensive data collection on cybercrime losses is needed to better understand the scope and to allocate appropriate countermeasures.
