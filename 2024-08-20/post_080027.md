### What Happened

In the first half of 2024, ransomware payments surged to nearly $460 million, indicating that this year might break the previous year's record of $1.1 billion. Despite disruptive law enforcement actions against large ransomware-as-a-service groups like LockBit, ransomware gangs have managed to increase their earnings by targeting larger organizations for higher ransoms. The alarming rise is further evidenced by the highest ransom payment ever recorded at $75 million to the Dark Angels group. Additionally, the median ransom payment skyrocketed from $199,000 in early 2023 to $1.5 million in June 2024.

### Why It Matters

This escalation in ransomware payouts signals a growing and increasingly lucrative threat landscape, mostly affecting large organizations and, potentially, public sector institutions like county governments. Higher ransom payments reflect not only the increasing sophistication of ransomware gangs but also their shifting tactics to inflict maximum financial damage. The significant rise in the median ransom cost also indicates that smaller entities could be priced out of mitigation strategies, creating a disproportionate risk. For counties, this means the stakes have never been higher for ensuring robust cybersecurity measures, impacting not just financial health but also public trust and service continuity.

### Actions to Be Taken

Given the rising ransomware threat, county governments should prioritize enhancing their cybersecurity frameworks. This involves conducting thorough vulnerability assessments and implementing stronger defensive measures such as multi-factor authentication, endpoint detection, and regular data backups. Additionally, investment in employee training to recognize and respond to phishing attacks can reduce incident occurrence. Collaborating with state and federal cybersecurity agencies for updated threat intelligence and best practices can also bolster security postures. Lastly, developing and rehearsing an incident response plan will ensure quick recovery and minimal disruption in the event of an attack.
