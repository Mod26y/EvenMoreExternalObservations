**1) What happened:**
Microsoft has implemented a compatibility block for Windows 11 24H2 upgrades for systems running AutoCAD 2022 due to issues preventing the application from launching. This block only applies to AutoCAD 2022 versions, while later editions like AutoCAD 2023, 2024, and 2025 remain unaffected. Microsoftâ€™s compatibility hold will stop the upgrade from being offered via Windows Update on affected machines. Users are advised not to manually upgrade using tools such as the Media Creation Tool until the issue is resolved, with specific guidance available to IT admins to identify impacted systems.

**2) Why it matters:**
The Windows 11 24H2 upgrade block on systems using AutoCAD 2022 highlights the importance of software compatibility in maintaining business continuity for organizations utilizing this application. AutoCAD is a critical tool for many in architecture, engineering, and design fields; hampered access can lead to operational disruptions and project delays. Additionally, it underscores the necessity for IT teams to be proactive in monitoring software updates and ensuring compatibility to safeguard against unexpected application failures that could impact productivity.

**3) What actions should be taken:**
Organizations should conduct an inventory of AutoCAD licenses to determine if they are using the 2022 version and evaluate the necessity of the Windows 11 24H2 upgrade in the short term. IT departments should inform users of the potential impact and delay any manual upgrades while Microsoft resolves the compatibility issue. Additionally, keeping communication open with stakeholders and monitoring updates from Microsoft for resolutions is critical. Consider evaluating the potential benefits of upgrading to compatible versions of AutoCAD to mitigate future risks associated with software incompatibility.
