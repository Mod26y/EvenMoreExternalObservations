**1) What happened:**

In 2023, a significant data breach occurred at Capita, a leading UK-based outsourcing and professional services company. The breach exposed the personal information of 6.6 million people and impacted hundreds of its clients, including 325 pension scheme providers. The breach began when a Capita employee inadvertently downloaded a malicious file, allowing hackers to infiltrate and exfiltrate nearly one terabyte of data from 4% of Capita’s IT infrastructure. The ransomware group Black Basta was involved, and Capita took 58 hours to isolate the infected systems. The UK's ICO fined Capita £14 million after the company acknowledged liability and improved its security measures.

**2) Why it matters:**

This breach underscores the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures in companies handling sensitive information. Capita's lapse in cybersecurity had severe implications, affecting millions of individuals and numerous organizations, and revealing systemic issues such as inadequate access controls and delayed response times. The hefty ICO fine highlights the potential financial repercussions for organizations that fail to protect data adequately. Furthermore, the incident illustrates the vulnerability of widely used digital tools like Microsoft 365 and emphasizes the persistent threat posed by professional ransomware groups.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should prioritize strengthening their cybersecurity posture by implementing strong access controls, including tiered admin accounts, and conducting regular penetration testing and risk assessments. It's essential to ensure sufficient staffing and investment in security operations centers for timely incident responses. Companies should educate employees on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities, particularly concerning email and file attachments. Furthermore, organizations need robust incident response plans to mitigate damage swiftly if breaches occur. Engaging regularly with external cybersecurity audits can help identify and rectify security weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.
