**What Happened:**

The article discusses the founding of Credible Security, an independent security consultancy established in 2025 by Josh Yavor, Kim Burton, and Jessica Walters. This firm emphasizes the importance of diverse backgrounds and experiences in cybersecurity, arguing that these attributes can act as a "superpower" for developing more effective security strategies. The company's focus is on B2B cloud services and software-as-a-service offerings, particularly targeting underserved teams and early-stage companies. The founders, bringing diverse professional backgrounds, believe that diverse perspectives help avoid groupthink and foster stronger security practices.

**Why It Matters:**

The significance of Credible Securityâ€™s approach lies in its challenge to the conventional, often homogenous, path of cybersecurity professionals. By integrating diverse experiences, the company addresses two critical issues: improving cybersecurity strategy by avoiding groupthink, and aligning security goals with broader business objectives. In an era where digital ecosystems are increasingly complex and cloud-based, diverse perspectives can improve risk management and strategic development. This broader approach not only aims to provide robust security services but also to use security as a competitive advantage, enhancing trust with end users.

**What Actions Should be Taken:**

Organizations should consider integrating diverse educational and professional backgrounds into their cybersecurity teams. Fostering this diversity can lead to innovative approaches to cybersecurity challenges, reduce potential blind spots caused by groupthink, and enhance the adaptability of security strategies. Additionally, companies should prioritize building trust over mere compliance, ensuring that trustworthiness is fundamentally ingrained in their business operations. By aligning security practices with business goals and adopting a proactive stance on trust building, organizations can create more resilient, customer-focused cybersecurity strategies that serve as a competitive differentiator.
