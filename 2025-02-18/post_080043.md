By resolving these issues, Microsoft underscores its commitment to maintaining robust system compatibility and user satisfaction across diverse hardware configurations.

3) **Actions to Be Taken**: Stakeholders in IT departments should prioritize disseminating information about the availability of this critical BIOS update to ASUS users within their networks to ensure smooth upgrades to Windows 11 24H2. It is advisable to monitor the update process to identify any residual issues and verify that systems operate efficiently post-update. Additionally, systems running other restricted software or configurations should be assessed for any remaining compatibility holds to facilitate comprehensive system upgrades and ensure all potential vulnerabilities are mitigated.
