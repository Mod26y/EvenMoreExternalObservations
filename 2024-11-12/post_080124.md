**What happened:** Cybercriminals are exploiting the flexible structure of zip files by using a technique called concatenation. This allows them to merge multiple archives into a single file, often used in phishing attacks to spread Trojans like SmokeLoader. Such files evade detection because some zip readers do not fully parse all contents, allowing malicious payloads to remain hidden. This strategic misuse involves sending emails with disguised zip or rar files that deceive users into believing they are normal documents, facilitating the stealthy distribution of malware.

**Why it matters:** This technique poses a significant risk as it exposes vulnerabilities in widely used archive readers, allowing malware to bypass standard detection methods. Because many security tools fail to thoroughly analyze concatenated zip files, threat actors can deploy malware undetected. This vulnerability increases the chances of successful phishing attacks, resulting in potential breaches, data theft, and further distribution of harmful payloads like ransomware or banking Trojans, thus endangering both individuals and organizations.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations should enhance their email security protocols by educating users on phishing threats, particularly those involving unexpected attachments. Implementing advanced security tools is critical to detect and analyze concatenated zip files, ensuring no hidden threats are overlooked. Enterprises should promote the use of archive readers that thoroughly assess all file layers and train employees to be cautious with emails urging urgent actions, especially when received from unknown senders. Regular audits and updates of cybersecurity practices will help mitigate these hidden risks.
