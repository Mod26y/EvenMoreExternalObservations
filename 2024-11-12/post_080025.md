1) What happened: The Ymir ransomware is a new threat that encrypts systems previously compromised by the RustyStealer malware. Initiated in July 2024, Ymir operates exclusively from memory to avoid detection, targeting systems by leveraging high-privileged credentials obtained through RustyStealer. The ransomware utilizes innovative techniques, including in-memory execution, and advanced encryption via the ChaCha20 cipher. Once activated, it informs victims of an attack via ransom notes. Without current evidence of established data exfiltration channels, Ymir primarily focuses on encryption and extortion.

2) Why it matters: The collaboration between RustyStealer and Ymir represents a growing trend of malware convergence, complicating detection and mitigating efforts for organizations. This complexity enhances the malware's ability to conduct sophisticated attacks involving lateral movement, credential theft, and encrypted system shutdowns. As cybercriminals target organizations worldwide, this development presents a significant risk to data integrity, system operability, and operational continuity across potentially vulnerable county systems.

3) What actions should be taken: County information security teams are advised to strengthen endpoint detection and response protocols to identify in-memory threats. Regularly update security tools, enforce strong authentication mechanisms to protect high-privilege accounts, and conduct continuous network monitoring to detect abnormal lateral movements. Educating staff on phishing and infostealer threats can help prevent initial infiltration. Backup critical data frequently to ensure restoration capabilities and conduct incident response simulations to improve readiness for ransomware incidents.
