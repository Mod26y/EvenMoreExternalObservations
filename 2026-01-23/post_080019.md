1) Curl, a command-line utility for data transfer, announced the termination of its bug bounty program via HackerOne, effective January 31, 2026. The decision is due to an overwhelming number of low-quality, often AI-generated vulnerability reports, which strained the security team's resources without contributing to meaningful vulnerability identification. Starting February 1, bug reports should be directed through GitHub, terminating the financial incentive for poorly researched submissions.

2) The situation highlights challenges posed by low-effort AI-generated content, which burdens project maintainers and can detract from genuine security efforts. For an open-source project like Curl with limited resources, managing such reports impacts productivity and mental well-being. This development underscores the importance of balancing open collaboration with efficient vetting processes and could influence how other similar projects manage vulnerability reporting.

3) Given this information, organizations should re-evaluate their vulnerability reporting processes to ensure they effectively filter out low-quality submissions, potentially by implementing stricter initial screening criteria. Embracing alternative methods like GitHub could streamline interactions while maintaining valuable collaborations. Organizations might also consider educating contributors on quality submission standards, emphasizing the importance of clarity and specificity in bug reports to better utilize limited resources.
