### 1) What happened

The Oregon Zoo experienced a data breach affecting its online ticketing service from December 2023 to June 2024. During this period, transactions were redirected to a phishing page by unauthorized actors, resulting in the compromise of visitors' payment card information, including names, card numbers, CVVs, and expiration dates. The issue was discovered on June 26, 2024, leading to the decommissioning of the compromised site and a detailed investigation. A total of 117,815 individuals were affected, and the Zoo has since implemented a more secure payment portal.

### 2) Why it matters

This breach is significant as it involves a widely visited public institution, potentially eroding trust among its patrons. The exposed payment card information can be used by cybercriminals to make unauthorized purchases, leading to financial losses and increased fraud. Such incidents also highlight vulnerabilities in digital transaction systems, making it crucial for organizations to strengthen their cybersecurity measures. Moreover, the breach exemplifies the growing cybersecurity threats facing public and private sectors alike, emphasizing the need for continuous vigilance and robust data protection mechanisms.

### 3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information

In response to this breach, organizations should conduct comprehensive reviews of their third-party vendor security practices to ensure robust protections are in place. Enhancing cybersecurity training for staff can help identify and respond to phishing attacks more effectively. Affected individuals should be advised to closely monitor their financial accounts for suspicious activities and consider replacing compromised payment cards. Additionally, offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection can aid in mitigating potential damage. Continuous updates and regular security audits are essential to safeguard against future breaches and maintain public trust.
