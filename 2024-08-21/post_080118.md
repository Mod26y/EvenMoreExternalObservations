1) **What Happened:**
The article from Dark Reading features a recurring monthly contest called "Name That Toon," where participants submit clever cybersecurity-related captions to a cartoon. The best caption wins a $25 Amazon gift card. The article outlines the different submission methods, including email and social media platforms, and congratulates the previous month's winner for his consecutive victory.

2) **Why It Matters:**
While this contest may seem light-hearted, it highlights an important aspect of the cybersecurity community: engagement and continuous education. Encouraging creativity and participation through informal contests helps keep cybersecurity professionals thinking critically about their field's challenges. Such activities can enhance awareness, foster a sense of community, and make complex concepts more approachable.

3) **What Actions Should Be Taken:**
Given the importance of community engagement and constant learning in cybersecurity, the county's information security steering committee could consider implementing similar initiatives. Organizing contests, webinars, or creating forums for sharing best practices could foster a culture of security awareness. By leveraging these participatory activities, the county can encourage ongoing education and community involvement, ultimately strengthening its cybersecurity posture.
