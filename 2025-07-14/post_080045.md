**1) What happened:** The article discusses a critical security vulnerability (CVE-2025-25257) discovered in Fortinet's FortiWeb, a web application firewall. This SQL injection flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands and potentially perform remote code execution on the vulnerable servers. Proof-of-concept exploits have been publicly released, increasing the risk of exploitation. The vulnerability, identified in FortiWeb's Fabric Connector software, involves improper neutralization of SQL commands, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code via HTTP requests. Fortinet released patches last week, with updates available in specific versions of FortiWeb.

**2) Why it matters:** The flaw's severity score of 9.8/10 highlights its critical nature, posing a significant threat to FortiWeb users. With FortiWeb playing a crucial role in safeguarding web applications from malicious traffic, any unpatched systems are exposed to potential unauthorized access and compromise. The release of proof-of-concept exploits means that malicious actors can quickly develop and deploy attacks against vulnerable systems. Given that wide availability of exploit details tends to accelerate the exploitation of vulnerabilities, timely patching is crucial to mitigate risks and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**3) What actions should be taken:** Prompt action is crucial to prevent potential exploitation of this vulnerability. Organizations utilizing Fortinet FortiWeb should prioritize updating to the patched versions (7.6.4, 7.4.8, 7.2.11, or 7.0.11 and later). It's advisable for cybersecurity teams to verify patch deployments and ensure all systems are updated to the latest secure versions. Additionally, continuous monitoring of network traffic for unusual activity and reviewing firewall logs can help identify suspicious actions. Incorporating regular vulnerability assessments and adopting a comprehensive security posture can further enhance protection against evolving threats.
