**1. What happened:**

A US District Court has dismissed a significant portion of the SECâ€™s lawsuit against SolarWinds and its CISO, Tim Brown. The court ruled that SolarWinds and Brown could not be held liable for statements and filings made post-breach of their flagship Orion product. However, the SEC can proceed with charges concerning the company's pre-breach cybersecurity posture misrepresentations. This ruling comes in response to SolarWinds' motion to dismiss the lawsuit, affirming that some disclosures and statements made prior to the breach were materially false and misleading.

**2. Why it matters:**

The ruling holds significant implications for the accountability and disclosure practices of publicly traded companies, particularly regarding cybersecurity incident management. By not holding SolarWinds and its leadership liable for post-breach communications, the court sets a precedent that may influence how companies disclose and manage cybersecurity incidents. This decision may encourage more open internal communication on security matters, reducing the fear among security professionals that their internal disclosures could lead to liability. It also emphasizes the importance of accurate and truthful pre-breach cybersecurity representations.

**3. What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

Organizations are encouraged to review their pre-breach cybersecurity posture and ensure honest and transparent communication about their security measures. Internal communications should be documented carefully, maintaining awareness that future allegations could scrutinize these details. Moreover, it's essential for CISOs and security teams to be consistently honest about their current security state, even if the assessment is negative, to avoid potential legal consequences. Institutions should also stay informed on legal developments in cybersecurity disclosure requirements to adjust their practices in alignment with legal expectations and industry standards.
