Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/winnti-hackers-target-other-threat-actors-with-new-glutton-php-backdoor/

1) What Happened:
The Winnti hacking group, known for state-sponsored cyber activities, has developed a new PHP backdoor called 'Glutton.' This backdoor is being used not only against targets in China and the U.S. but also in targeting other cybercriminal groups. The tool is a modular backdoor designed to be stealthy and flexible, allowing for tailored attacks. Glutton is particularly potent against PHP web development frameworks and targets IT services, social security agencies, and web app developers. It also employs a unique "black eats black" strategy to infiltrate and exploit other cybercriminals' systems.

2) Why it Matters:
Glutton represents a significant evolution in the Winnti group's capabilities, given its modularity and stealth. The backdoor's deployment against both legitimate organizations and other cybercriminals highlights the increasingly complex landscape of cyber threats. Critical sectors such as IT services and social security are at risk, potentially compromising sensitive data. Furthermore, targeting other cybercriminals indicates a shift in hacker dynamics, where malware is weaponized against peers, complicating traditional threat profiles. Awareness and understanding of these emerging tactics are vital for organizations to adapt security measures accordingly.

3) What Actions Should Be Taken:
Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity monitoring and threat detection capabilities, focusing on identifying unusual PHP and related web framework activities. Regular security audits and updates, particularly for web applications and frameworks, are essential. Collaboration with cybersecurity firms can help in utilizing shared indicators of compromise to detect potential threats early. Educating IT staff about new tactics like the "black eats black" strategy will reinforce information security measures. Additionally, leveraging threat intelligence could provide broader insight and allow for proactive steps against such evolving threats.
