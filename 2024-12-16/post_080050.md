**1) What happened:**

Versa Networks has announced a new Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (DLP) capability integrated into their Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solution via the VersaONE platform. This feature enhances data protection on endpoints by preventing data exfiltration through methods like copy/paste, screenshots, or peripheral devices, using Zero Trust principles. This DLP solution extends coverage from the network to individual endpoints, offering real-time visibility and control while ensuring compliance with data security regulations. It simplifies enterprise security by integrating network and endpoint DLP into a unified system.

**2) Why it matters:**

This announcement is significant as it addresses critical aspects of data security in the context of hybrid work environments where endpoints are particularly vulnerable. With the rise in remote work, organizations face heightened risks from insider threats and accidental data leaks. By offering an integrated endpoint DLP solution within a SASE platform, Versa streamlines security management and policy enforcement across the entire IT infrastructure, reducing complexity and enhancing threat protection. This unified approach helps enterprises maintain compliance and mitigate data exfiltration risks without degrading employee productivity or user experience.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

Organizations should assess their current cybersecurity posture, especially regarding endpoint security and data protection measures. Security teams might consider evaluating the new Versa Endpoint DLP feature as part of their SASE strategy to ensure comprehensive data protection across both networks and endpoints. Additionally, CISOs and IT leaders should review their data loss prevention policies and leverage such integrated solutions to strengthen defenses against insider threats and data compliance challenges. Training employees about data security practices, especially in remote work settings, can further bolster organizational defenses.
