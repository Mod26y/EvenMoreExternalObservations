Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-office-2016-and-office-2019-reach-end-of-support-next-month/

**1) What happened:**

Microsoft has announced that support for Office 2016 and Office 2019 will cease on October 14, 2025. This encompasses related applications such as Visio and Project for those versions. Post this date, these software will not receive updates, security fixes, or technical support. Despite the software functioning post-support, using it may lead to security vulnerabilities. Microsoft urges users to transition to Microsoft 365 Apps or newer products like Office 2024 or Office LTSC 2024 to ensure continued security and functionality, as they provide updated features and extended support until October 2029.

**2) Why it matters:**

The cessation of support for Office 2016 and Office 2019 is significant as it highlights a looming security risk for organizations still using these products. Without updates or security fixes, systems become vulnerable to cyber threats that could exploit unpatched software vulnerabilities. Additionally, non-compliance with industry standards may occur if outdated software is in use, which could have legal and financial repercussions. Therefore, it is crucial for organizations to transition to newer software versions to maintain secure, compliant, and efficient IT environments.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should assess their current usage of Office 2016 and Office 2019 and prioritize plans to upgrade to Microsoft 365 Apps or other updated Office versions like Office 2024. Conducting an inventory of systems reliant on these software versions will allow for a structured transition, ensuring critical business operations remain unaffected. Additionally, informing employees about the change and providing training on new functionalities can ease the migration process. Collaboration with IT departments or external consultants might also be necessary to ensure a smooth upgrade, minimizing potential disruptions while optimizing the benefits from new software capabilities.
