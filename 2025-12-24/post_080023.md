**What happened:**  
Two malicious Chrome extensions named 'Phantom Shuttle' were discovered in the Chrome Web Store. These extensions masquerade as proxy service tools, designed to intercept and hijack user traffic, primarily targeting users in China. They have been active since at least 2017 and use proxies controlled by threat actors to steal sensitive data like credentials and session cookies via man-in-the-middle attacks. The threat actors employed a custom encoding scheme to obfuscate their code and dynamically reconfigured Chrome's proxy settings to route traffic through their infrastructure.

**Why it matters:**  
The presence of these extensions poses a significant threat to user privacy and data security, underscoring the vulnerability of browser extensions as attack vectors. By hijacking web traffic, these extensions can exploit sensitive personal and business information, potentially leading to significant financial and reputational damage for individuals and organizations. Their persistent presence since 2017 highlights challenges in policing and securing the vast ecosystem of browser extensions, emphasizing the need for more stringent security measures and user awareness.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Users should critically evaluate extensions before installing them, paying attention to user reviews and permissions requested during installation. Organizations could implement policies to limit employees’ ability to install unauthorized extensions and deploy monitoring tools to detect suspicious network traffic. Additionally, browser developers like Google should enhance their vetting processes for extensions and develop more sophisticated monitoring systems to identify and remove malicious extensions proactively. Security-awareness training programs can also help individuals recognize and mitigate such threats effectively.
