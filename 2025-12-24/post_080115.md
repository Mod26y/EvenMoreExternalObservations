1) "Operation Sentinel" successfully dismantled several African cybercrime syndicates. Although specific details from the article are inaccessible, such operations generally involve coordinated efforts by international law enforcement agencies aiming to curtail organized cybercriminal activities. This typically includes arrests, seizures of criminal infrastructure, and prevention of fraud schemes that might target businesses, government institutions, and individuals globally.

2) The operation's impact is significant because it mitigates threats from rapidly growing cybercrime organizations that exploit technological vulnerabilities worldwide. Such schemes can lead to financial loss, erode trust in digital systems, and compromise sensitive data. Reducing the operational capabilities of these syndicates can lower the risk to businesses and governmental systems.

3) In response to the situation highlighted by "Operation Sentinel," organizations should enhance their cybersecurity posture by fostering international collaboration and information-sharing initiatives. They should conduct regular network security assessments, improve incident response strategies, and engage in cybersecurity awareness training. These proactive measures can strengthen defense mechanisms against potential threats from dismantled but potentially adaptable cybercriminal groups.
