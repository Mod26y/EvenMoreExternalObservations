**What happened:**
A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit has been released for a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager, known as CVE-2024-29847. This flaw, stemming from insecure deserialization of untrusted data, affects versions of Ivanti Endpoint Manager prior to 2022 SU6 and EPM 2024. The vulnerability enables remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the deprecated Microsoft .NET Remoting framework. Despite being fixed in the September 2024 update, the public release of the exploit details heightens the risk of active exploitation.

**Why it matters:**
The public release of the exploit code significantly raises the risk of widespread attacks leveraging CVE-2024-29847. Since Ivanti Endpoint Manager is widely used to manage and secure enterprise devices, successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and complete system compromise, affecting a broad range of organizations. The urgency is compounded by the lack of alternative mitigations, making it essential to apply the provided "hot patch" updates to prevent potentially severe impacts.

**What actions should be taken:**
Organizations utilizing Ivanti Endpoint Manager versions prior to 2022 SU6 and EPM 2024 should apply the latest security updates immediately to mitigate the risk posed by CVE-2024-29847. Reviewing and verifying that these updates have been successfully implemented is crucial. Additionally, it's advisable to conduct a thorough security audit of systems managed by Ivanti Endpoint Manager to detect any signs of compromise and reinforce network monitoring for unusual activities. This proactive approach helps safeguard against potential exploitation stemming from this vulnerability.
