**1) What happened:**

The article outlines the primary cybersecurity threats anticipated for the 2024 US presidential election. These threats include potential hacking of voting machines, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on election infrastructure, ransomware targeting municipalities, website defacements, and email access breaches. While the likelihood of actual vote tampering is low due to robust security measures, threats like DDoS attacks and ransomware could disrupt local election processes temporarily. 

**2) Why it matters:**

These evolving cybersecurity threats reflect a critical concern for the integrity and smooth operation of US elections. Even if the technical security of vote casting remains uncompromised, the disruption of election information systems, voter data, or communications could undermine public trust and create chaos during election periods. Elections are foundational to democracy, and any threat, however minor, can have significant implications for public confidence in the electoral process.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Given these insights, municipal election systems should focus on bolstering their defenses against DDoS attacks and ransomware. This includes adopting robust DDoS protection services, like Google's Project Shield and Cloudflare offerings, and ensuring regular backups and prompt incident response plans for ransomware. Election-related websites should implement heightened cybersecurity measures to prevent defacement and phishing attacks. Additionally, all political entities should enforce strong security protocols like multifactor authentication for email accounts to mitigate social engineering threats. Maintaining transparent communication channels with the voting public about the validity and security of election processes will also be crucial in preserving voter confidence.
