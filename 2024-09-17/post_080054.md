### What Happened
Microsoft has launched Office LTSC (Long Term Servicing Channel) 2024 for Windows and Mac, a volume-licensed and perpetual version of Office aimed at commercial and government customers. This version is designed for devices that require long-term support and often lack internet connectivity, like medical equipment. Key improvements include enhanced performance, security, and accessibility, along with expanded features in Outlook and Excel. The Microsoft Teams app is now a separate download, and Microsoft Publisher will be retired after October 2026. Support for Office LTSC 2024 will last five years under the Fixed Lifecycle Policy.

### Why It Matters
The introduction of Office LTSC 2024 is significant for organizations that operate in environments where internet access is limited or security requirements are stringent, such as medical facilities and certain government sectors. These entities often need reliable, long-term software solutions without the risk of frequent updates that could disrupt operations. The security and performance improvements in Office LTSC 2024 make it a viable option for such specialized needs, ensuring that critical systems remain secure and functional without requiring constant internet connectivity.

### What Actions Should Be Taken as a Result of This Information
Organizations operating in specialized environments should evaluate the benefits of transitioning to Office LTSC 2024, considering it offers long-term support and enhanced security features. IT departments should prepare for the transition by assessing their current software inventory to identify outdated components like Microsoft Publisher, planning for its retirement post-2026. Additionally, cybersecurity teams should ensure that the deployment and management tools for hybrid environments are up-to-date to facilitate seamless integration with existing Microsoft 365 Apps. Regular security updates should also be scheduled to maintain system integrity and protect against vulnerabilities.
