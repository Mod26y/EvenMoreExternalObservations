**What Happened:**

A new variant of the Mirai botnet is exploiting a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting DigiEver DS-2105 Pro NVRs and outdated TP-Link routers. The attacks began in October, targeting devices with specific vulnerabilities, including those identified by researcher Ta-Lun Yen. The botnet compromises devices through command injection, using them for distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and further propagation. This variant employs complex encryption methods and targets various architectures, indicating evolved tactics by Mirai operators. Notably, it exploits CVE-2023-1389 and CVE-2018-17532 on TP-Link and Teltonika devices, respectively.

**Why It Matters:**

The exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities in widely-used devices like NVRs and routers poses significant security risks, enabling large-scale botnet activities. These compromised devices can be weaponized for DDoS attacks, disrupting critical online services and causing financial and operational damage. Furthermore, the use of advanced encryption techniques in this Mirai variant suggests increasingly sophisticated methods employed by attackers, posing challenges for detection and mitigation. This trend underlines the importance of timely patching and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities, especially as attackers expand their targeting to a variety of device architectures.

**What Actions Should be Taken:**

Organizations should assess their current device inventory to ensure no unresolved vulnerabilities exist, particularly focusing on DigiEver, TP-Link, and Teltonika devices. Regular updates and patch management processes should be reinforced to address known vulnerabilities like CVE-2023-1389 and CVE-2018-17532. Implementing security measures such as network segmentation, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems can help mitigate the risk of compromise. Additionally, utilizing IoCs and Yara rules from Akamai's report can aid in the detection and prevention of this botnet, while educating teams about evolving threat vectors remains imperative for maintaining robust cybersecurity defenses.
