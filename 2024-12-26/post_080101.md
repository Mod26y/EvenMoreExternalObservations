**1) What happened?**

The article discusses how the role of Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) has evolved to include regular communication with their organization's board of directors. In the past, CISOs rarely presented to the board, but 49% now report at least weekly. This shift reflects increased board interest in cybersecurity due to the visibility and potential impact of breaches. The article provides guidance for CISOs on effectively communicating their strategies and risks, emphasizing the necessity to prepare thoroughly, align cybersecurity objectives with business goals, and convey information in a manner that board members can readily understand.

**2) Why it matters:**

The evolving responsibilities of CISOs are significant because they reflect a broader organizational recognition of cybersecurity as a critical component of business strategy. By frequently interacting with the board, CISOs can secure better alignment of cybersecurity initiatives with business objectives, ensuring that resources and strategies are focused effectively. Moreover, enhanced communication skills enable CISOs to secure necessary budget allocations and foster a security-first culture across the organization. As cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated, building this strategic bridge between technical security issues and business imperatives is crucial for organizational resilience and informed decision-making at the highest levels.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

Organizations should encourage CISOs to hone their communication skills, focusing on conveying cybersecurity initiatives and risks in business terms. This involves adopting a preparation-intensive approach, collaborating with other executives, and learning to present security data succinctly and effectively. CISOs should build alliances within the board to receive feedback on presentations and align their objectives with broader business goals. Organizations can also facilitate this transition by providing CISOs with training and resources to develop business acumen. Fostering an environment where CISOs are proactive partners with the board, rather than mere responders to incidents, will strengthen the organization's cybersecurity posture.
