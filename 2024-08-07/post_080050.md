The disruption affected a significant number of students, impacting their access to learning materials and raising concerns among users and stakeholders about the platform's security measures. Cybersecurity in the educational sector is paramount as it holds sensitive data and impacts the digital learning environment. Ensuring these systems are secure safeguards students' data and maintains trust in educational technologies.

3) What actions should be taken: In response to this incident, the following actions are recommended: First, schools and educational institutions using similar platforms should review and strengthen their cybersecurity protocols, including regular security audits and implementation of multi-factor authentication. Second, there should be a review of incident response plans to ensure rapid and effective actions in the event of a breach. Finally, educational bodies should consider alternative or supplementary solutions to minimize dependency on a single platform, ensuring continuity of education even if one system fails or is compromised.
