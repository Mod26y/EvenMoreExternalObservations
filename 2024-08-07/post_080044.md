**What happened:**
The Grand Palais Réunion des musées nationaux (Rmn) in France experienced a ransomware cyberattack on August 3, 2024. The attack disrupted operational systems, leading to the shutdown of systems to contain the threat, which affected the bookstores and boutiques at various museums. Despite initial concerns, no major operational interruptions were reported for the museum sites or the Olympic events hosted at the Grand Palais. An investigation by France's cybersecurity agency, ANSSI, is ongoing, with early indications suggesting the attack was facilitated through stolen credentials obtained via info-stealer malware.

**Why it matters:**
This incident underscores the critical vulnerability of cultural and historical institutions to cyber threats, particularly during high-profile events like the Olympic Games which attract global attention. Given the Grand Palais’s significant role in hosting Olympic events and tourism-related activities, any operational disruption could have broader economic and reputational repercussions. The attack also highlights the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals, who successfully exploited stolen credentials, showing that even trusted collaborators can be entry points for cyber threats.

**What actions should be taken:**
Organizations should prioritize reviewing and strengthening their cybersecurity protocols, especially those involved in high-visibility events or critical infrastructure. Employee education and awareness programs should be bolstered to reduce the risk of credential theft and phishing attacks. Regularly updating and patching systems can minimize vulnerabilities exploited by malware. Implementing robust network monitoring and response strategies allows for quicker containment and remediation. Collaboration with national cybersecurity agencies can provide essential support and resources. The Grand Palais’s response can be a case study to refine incident response plans to better handle and mitigate future cyber-attacks.
