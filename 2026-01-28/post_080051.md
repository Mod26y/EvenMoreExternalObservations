The article reports on the ongoing exploitation of a high-severity vulnerability in WinRAR, identified as CVE-2025-8088. This path traversal flaw enables attackers to plant malicious files at arbitrary locations via Alternate Data Streams (ADS), targeting the Windows Startup folder for persistence. Threat actors, including state-sponsored entities and financially motivated cybercriminals, have used this flaw for initial system access and payload delivery. ESET researchers first discovered this vulnerability, with Google Threat Intelligence Group noting exploitation from mid-2025. Groups such as RomCom and APT44 have been leveraging this vulnerability for targeted attacks, particularly against Ukrainian entities.

Exploitation of CVE-2025-8088 is significant as it demonstrates the continued vulnerability of systems to well-known software applications like WinRAR. The issue allows a low-friction attack vector for hackers to persistently infiltrate systems, posing threats across global geopolitical and economic sectors. Furthermore, the commoditization of exploits reduces the technical barrier for carrying out sophisticated cyberattacks, highlighting the need for organizations to keep up with patch management and secure configurations to mitigate risks effectively.

Organizations should prioritize updating WinRAR to patched versions and performing an audit of existing deployments to ensure compliance with security best practices. Additionally, implementing robust endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools can help detect unusual activities associated with path traversal exploits. Regular training and awareness programs for users regarding safe handling of attachments and awareness of spearphishing tactics can further diminish the risks posed by such vulnerabilities. Continuous monitoring for suspicious activity in network traffic and system logs is also advised to identify and respond to potential threats promptly.
