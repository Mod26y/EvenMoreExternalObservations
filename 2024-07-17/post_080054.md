1) **What happened:**
In May 2024, threat actor UNC5537 executed a significant data breach affecting Snowflake customers. The attackers leveraged exposed, legitimate credentials found online or purchased, rather than using sophisticated hacking methods. They accessed accounts on the Snowflake platform without multifactor authentication (MFA). Once in, they stole data from around 165 companies, affecting high-profile entities like Ticketmaster and Santander. The credentials, originally harvested by infostealer malware, were still valid due to lack of rotation and updating. Moreover, the compromised accounts lacked network allow lists, allowing unrestricted access.

2) **Why it matters:**
The breach highlights vulnerabilities in credential management and the critical need for implementing MFA. It showcases how inadequate password policies and absence of advanced security measures can lead to massive breaches without sophisticated hacking techniques. The breach's scale and the prominent victims involved illustrate the potentially severe consequences, including data theft and financial loss. This incident reinforces the importance of proactive cybersecurity practices, particularly for organizations utilizing cloud storage services that house extensive, sensitive data.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
Organizations should enhance their security measures by enabling MFA, a straightforward and highly effective defense against unauthorized access. Regularly updating and rotating credentials is crucial to mitigate risks associated with stolen credentials. Monitoring the Dark Web for exposed credentials and acting promptly if credentials are found compromised can prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, implementing network allow lists can restrict access to trusted entities, thereby reducing the attack surface. Finally, monitoring for potential threats targeting vendors can provide early warnings, allowing organizations to preemptively secure their systems and validate their security compliance.
