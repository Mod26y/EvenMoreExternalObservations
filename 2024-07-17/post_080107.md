**1) What Happened:**

The Linux Foundation and the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) released a report titled "Secure Software Development Education 2024 Survey: Understanding Current Needs." The report is based on a survey of nearly 400 software development professionals. It highlights the pressing need for formalized education and training in secure software development. Alarmingly, many developers lack essential knowledge and skills in this area, with nearly one-third of survey participants admitting unfamiliarity with secure development practices. This is concerning given their role in creating and maintaining critical systems.

**2) Why It Matters:**

The significance of this report lies in exposing a critical knowledge gap in secure software development among professionals, which can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities and catastrophic consequences. As developers are at the forefront of creating and maintaining essential systems, their unfamiliarity with secure practices heightens the risk of cyberattacks. Additionally, the report underscores that current educational programs emphasize functionality over security, emphasizing the need for an industry-wide effort to prioritize secure development education.

**3) What Actions Should Be Taken:**

Organizations should consider incorporating formalized secure software development education and training into their professional development programs. They can encourage their development teams to enroll in courses offered by OpenSSF, such as the free online course "Developing Secure Software (LFD121)." To address knowledge gaps more effectively, companies might explore developing partnerships with educational institutions to integrate security-focused training into their curricula. Additionally, organizations could allocate dedicated time for developers to learn and practice secure coding to overcome challenges such as lack of time and training.
