The article likely discusses the significance of Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) aligning cybersecurity strategies with overarching business objectives. This alignment is crucial because it ensures that security measures support and enhance business goals, rather than obstruct them. Moreover, this approach facilitates better risk management and prioritization of resources, aligning cybersecurity expenditures with areas of highest strategic value or risk. 

Understanding the interplay between business and cybersecurity objectives is increasingly important as cyber threats become more sophisticated and impactful on business operations. For a county steering committee, integrating security initiatives with business strategy promotes efficiency, strengthens risk management, and ensures continuity of services critical to constituents.

County leaders should consider fostering collaboration between cybersecurity teams and business units to ensure security measures are prioritized according to business impact. This could involve regular cross-departmental meetings to evaluate and adjust cybersecurity strategies in line with evolving business needs. Further, investing in training for both IT and business staff on the importance of this alignment could strengthen understanding and cooperation across departments.
