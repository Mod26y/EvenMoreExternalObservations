WestJet faced a cyberattack that disrupted access to its internal systems and app, affecting user logins and operations. The airline is collaborating with law enforcement and regulatory bodies to investigate and manage the incident. While the full extent of the impact is unclear, the situation could involve a ransomware attack or precautionary system shutdowns. Systems have been partially restored, but it's still a significant disruption for the company and its customers.

This incident underscores the cybersecurity risks faced by large organizations, especially those within critical infrastructure sectors like aviation. The temporary loss of access to critical systems signals potential vulnerabilities that could compromise both operational continuity and personal data protection. Given the possibility of ransomware, there's also a substantial financial risk involved which can affect the company's reputation and clients' trust.

In response, organizations should reinforce cybersecurity measures by regularly updating and patching systems, conducting threat assessments, and training staff on recognizing phishing attacks. Implementing robust incident response plans and simulating breach scenarios can prepare them for future attacks. Establishing a crisis communication strategy is also vital to quickly inform stakeholders about any disruptions and the measures taken to address them.
