Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-46-000-grafana-instances-exposed-to-account-takeover-bug/

1) What happened: The article reports on a vulnerability affecting over 46,000 Grafana instances due to a client-side open redirect flaw identified as CVE-2025-4123. This flaw permits account takeover by allowing attackers to execute malicious plugins through crafted URLs. Discovered by Alvaro Balada, and despite a patch released on May 21, a significant number of Grafana instances remain unpatched, leaving them exposed to exploitation.

2) Why it matters: This vulnerability holds significant consequences because it does not require elevated privileges or authentication, broadening its potential attack surface. Attackers can hijack sessions, manipulate credentials, and engage in server-side request forgery. The unpatched instances exacerbate the risk of exploitation, presenting significant concerns for organizations relying on Grafana for infrastructure monitoring, potentially compromising sensitive information and disrupting operations.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should prioritize patching their Grafana instances by upgrading to the secure versions specified by the Grafana team. IT administrators should review their current installations and ensure all endpoints are updated promptly to reduce exposure to potential attacks. Additionally, awareness should be raised about the nature of the exploitation to inform users of the risks and defensive measures, reinforcing the importance of timely application updates and cautious URL interactions. The use of automated patch management tools could be considered to streamline the patching process.
