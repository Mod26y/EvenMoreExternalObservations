The FBI has identified a significant increase in account takeover fraud, with cybercriminals stealing over $262 million by impersonating financial institutions. This surge, monitored since January 2025, has impacted thousands, including individuals and businesses across various sectors. The schemes involve social engineering tactics to gain unauthorized access to accounts, followed by transferring funds into hard-to-trace cryptocurrency wallets. Criminals often manipulate victims by pretending to be bank or law enforcement officials, using phishing websites and search engine optimization poisoning to deceive users into revealing sensitive information.
