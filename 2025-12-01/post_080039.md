Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-windows-updates-hide-password-icon-on-lock-screen/

1) What happened: Microsoft reported that updates to Windows 11, beginning August 2025, could cause the password sign-in icon to disappear from the lock screen, especially for users with multiple sign-in options. Despite its invisibility, the button remains functional if users hover over the designated space. This issue arose from the August non-security preview update. Microsoft has acknowledged this glitch and is working on a resolution without releasing a specific timeline.

2) Why it matters: The vanishing password icon complicates the login process and may contribute to user frustration or security concerns, particularly in environments heavily relying on password authentication. Visibility issues could lead to confusion, potentially hindering user productivity and system accessibility. Moreover, ongoing update-related issues could undermine trust in Microsoft's update processes, highlighting the critical need for thorough testing before release.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should inform their employees about this potential issue and instruct them that hovering over the intended icon spot will reveal the password option, ensuring continued access. IT departments should monitor Microsoft's updates for patches addressing this bug and regularly communicate advances to users. It remains vital to continue implementing diverse login methods for enhanced security and prepare staff for potential workarounds until a permanent solution is endorsed by Microsoft.
