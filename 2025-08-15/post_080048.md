1) This attack involves threat actors using a Unicode character, "ã‚“", to construct deceptive Booking.com phishing links that appear legitimate at a glance. This tactic exploits homoglyphs, characters that look similar to others but belong to different scripts, deceiving users into clicking malicious links. Users are led to a fake Booking.com domain, resulting in the execution of malicious software through an MSI installer. Other campaigns similarly exploit lookalike domains, such as "Lntuit" instead of "Intuit," highlighting a widespread application of character manipulation in phishing strategies.

2) This attack matters due to its sophisticated use of visual deception, which makes it difficult for users to distinguish between legitimate and malicious domains. The Unicode manipulation exploits users' trust and familiarity with well-known domains, increasing the likelihood of successful phishing. By using homoglyphs, attackers bypass typical URL inspections and exploit human error, emphasizing the need for increased awareness and vigilant security practices in organizational settings.

3) As a result, organizations should enhance user education on spotting deceptive URLs and emphasize the importance of scrutinizing email links. Implementing advanced email filtering and threat detection systems can also help in identifying suspicious URLs. Additionally, organizations should maintain updated endpoint security software to capture and mitigate malware infections. Encouraging users to verify the actual registered domain beyond visual appearances and employing multi-factor authentication can further safeguard against these sophisticated phishing attacks.
