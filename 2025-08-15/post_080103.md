1) The article reports that state and local leaders are appealing to Congress for more cybersecurity resources. This has likely been propelled by the increasing number of cyberattacks and data breaches affecting these governmental levels. The leaders are seeking additional funding, improved collaboration tools, and enhanced support systems to better shield their infrastructures from growing cyber threats.

3) Based on this information, state and local governments should consider evaluating their current cybersecurity strategies to identify vulnerabilities. It's also beneficial to explore partnerships and collaboration opportunities with federal agencies and private sectors to leverage shared resources and expertise. Investing in cybersecurity training and awareness programs for government employees can significantly enhance their ability to respond to and mitigate cyber threats effectively.
