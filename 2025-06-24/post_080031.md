**What happened:**

The SparkKitty malware was discovered in apps on both Google Play and the Apple App Store, targeting Android and iOS devices. This malware primarily focused on stealing images from users' photo galleries, particularly aiming to extract cryptocurrency wallet recovery phrases captured in screenshots or photos. SparkKitty evolved from the earlier SparkCat malware, which utilized OCR for similar thefts. Malicious apps containing SparkKitty, such as Â∏Åcoin and SOEX, were distributed through both official app stores and unofficial channels. These apps were removed upon discovery, and affected companies are being contacted for comments.

**Why it matters:**

This incident underscores the persistent threat that malware poses, even on trusted platforms like official app stores. The popularity and convenience of app stores make them critical targets for attackers aiming to deploy malware at scale. This breach highlights vulnerabilities in vetting processes and reminds users that app store presence doesn't equate to safety. The consequences, particularly the theft of cryptocurrency through seed phrases, can be financially devastating. Thus, the incident not only impacts individual security but also shakes trust in digital commerce and highlights the importance of stringent cybersecurity practices.

**What actions should be taken:**

Users should scrutinize app listings for authenticity by examining reviews and publisher histories. During app installations, any request for gallery or storage access should be critically assessed, particularly if unrelated to the app's core functionality. It's beneficial for Android users to enable Google Play Protect and conduct regular scans. Both Android and iOS users should avoid storing sensitive recovery phrases digitally on devices. Instead, they should opt for secure, offline storage solutions. Organizations must enhance app review processes and engage in proactive security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future, ensuring rapid identification and removal of malicious apps.
