### 1) What happened

The United States is facing a critical shortage of cybersecurity professionals, with over 470,000 job openings left unfilled. In response, the White House Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD), alongside the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), launched the "Service for America" initiative. This program is part of the National Cyber Workforce and Education Strategy (NCWES) and aims to address the talent gap by promoting skills-based hiring, removing degree requirements, and encouraging apprenticeships to offer practical, on-the-job learning experiences. These efforts are also aimed to make the industry more accessible to traditionally underrepresented groups.

### 2) Why it matters

This shortage of cybersecurity professionals poses significant risks to national security, critical infrastructure, and private enterprises. As cyber threats become more sophisticated, the need for a skilled workforce is more crucial than ever to protect against data breaches, ransomware, and nation-state cyberattacks. The new initiative not only acknowledges the talent gap but takes actionable steps to build a diverse and skilled workforce. By focusing on skills over formal education, it opens doors for talented individuals from non-traditional backgrounds, thereby broadening the talent pool and introducing new perspectives to the field.

### 3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information

The County's information security steering committee should consider collaborating with local educational institutions and training programs to create apprenticeship and skills-based training pathways for cybersecurity roles within the county. Outreach efforts to attract non-traditional candidates and underrepresented communities can be strengthened. Additionally, the HR departments should revisit job descriptions and hiring criteria to focus more on skills and certifications rather than formal degrees. Regular internal training sessions can help upskill current employees, while partnerships with federal initiatives can keep the county's cybersecurity workforce robust and prepared for emerging threats.
