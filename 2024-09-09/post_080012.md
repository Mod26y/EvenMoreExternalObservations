### What Happened

A new variant of sextortion email scams is targeting individuals by alleging that their spouse is cheating. These emails utilize personally identifiable information (PII) such as full names, including less frequently used names like maiden names or nicknames, to increase credibility. The scammers claim to have proof of the spouse's infidelity and direct recipients to a website for more information, potentially attempting to steal login credentials or distribute malware. Despite the alarming nature of the emails, most recipients recognize them as scams and delete them.

### Why It Matters

This type of sextortion scam presents a significant emotional and psychological threat to individuals, leveraging sensitive and sometimes obscure personal information to create a sense of urgency and distress. Given the use of detailed personal data, there’s potential that this information was obtained from a data breach, possibly from a platform like The Knot. The scam’s ability to generate significant sums of money quickly highlights the effectiveness and danger of these tactics. Awareness is crucial, as individuals under emotional stress might act impulsively, compromising their security.

### Actions to Take

Organizations, particularly those dealing with sensitive personal information, should enhance their data protection protocols and ensure that any breaches are promptly reported and mitigated. Additionally, educational initiatives can be undertaken to inform employees and the public about recognizing and handling such scams. Monitoring platforms like The Knot for potential breaches can help in identifying the source of leaked information. Finally, encouraging users to implement strong privacy settings and regularly update passwords can reduce the risk of information misuse in scams.
