**1) What happened:**
The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of two critical industrial control system (ICS) vulnerabilities in healthcare and critical manufacturing sectors. The vulnerabilities affect Baxter's Connex Health Portal and Mitsubishi Electric's MELSEC programmable controllers. Baxter's flaws include a maximum severity SQL injection (CVE-2024-6795) and improper access control (CVE-2024-6796). Mitsubishi's vulnerabilities are Denial of Service (DoS) issues disclosed under CVE-2020-5652 and CVE-2022-33324. Both Baxter and Mitsubishi have released updates and mitigation advice for these vulnerabilities.

**2) Why it matters:**
These vulnerabilities are significant because they affect critical sectors prone to cyberattacks, with severe potential impacts on operations and patient safety. The Baxter vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely with low complexity, enabling attackers to access, modify, or delete sensitive data. Given the healthcare sector's increased targeting by cybercriminals, these flaws present considerable risks. Similarly, vulnerabilities in Mitsubishi's ICS pose threats to the manufacturing sector, which has seen a 165% surge in cyberattacks. Exploiting these flaws could lead to substantial operational disruptions and data breaches within critical infrastructures.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**
Organizations using Baxter's Connex Health Portal should promptly apply the vendor's updates and consider CISA's recommendations: minimizing network exposure for control systems, using firewalls, and secure remote access methods like VPNs. Healthcare entities need to be especially vigilant due to the sector's attractiveness to cybercriminals. For those using Mitsubishi's MELSEC controllers, updating systems based on the vendor's latest advisories and implementing recommended mitigations is crucial. Additionally, regular patch management and vulnerability assessments can help ensure that critical systems remain secure against emerging threats.
