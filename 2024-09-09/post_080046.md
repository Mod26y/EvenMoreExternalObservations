1. **What Happened?**
The use of commercial spyware, despite sanctions and enforcement actions primarily by Western governments, has resurged. Spyware vendors have adapted by improving their evasion tactics, such as anonymizing customer operations and restructuring their businesses to bypass sanctions. This enables these vendors to continue their activities in secret. Spyware known for human rights abuses, like Pegasus and Predator, continues to be used extensively, despite international efforts to halt their proliferation. The spyware vendor landscape remains heavily concentrated in countries like Israel, India, and Italy.

2. **Why It Matters:**
The resurgence and evolution of commercial spyware have significant implications for global cybersecurity and human rights. These tools are often used by authoritarian regimes to oppress journalists, dissidents, and ordinary citizens. The ability of spyware vendors to evade sanctions endangers individual privacy and national security globally. It highlights the inefficacy of current measures to control cyber espionage and stresses the need for more robust, cooperative international efforts to regulate and monitor the spyware industry comprehensively.

3. **What Actions Should Be Taken?**
A multi-faceted approach can be adopted to tackle the spyware issue effectively. First, enhance corporate transparency requirements to compel companies to disclose their beneficial owners, facilitating better due diligence. Second, expand the focus of international sanctions to include spyware companies operating in regions like India and Italy. Third, improve collaboration among nations to tighten the regulatory loopholes that allow spyware vendors to evade sanctions. Lastly, consider more rigorous review processes for both inbound and outbound investments related to cybersecurity to prevent funding from indirectly aiding spyware development and proliferation.
