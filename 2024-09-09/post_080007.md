### 1. What Happened?

Progress Software identified and patched a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-7591) in its LoadMaster and LoadMaster Multi-Tenant (MT) Hypervisor products. This bug allows unauthenticated, remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands via a specially crafted HTTP request, exploiting an improper input validation flaw. The vulnerability affects LoadMaster version 7.2.60.0 and all earlier versions, as well as the MT Hypervisor version 7.1.35.11 and prior versions. Progress released an add-on package to mitigate the issue, but the free version of LoadMaster remains vulnerable.

### 2. Why It Matters

The severity level of this vulnerability is 10/10, indicating extreme risk. Successful exploitation can allow attackers to gain full control over affected devices, jeopardizing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical network services. LoadMaster and MT Hypervisor are widely deployed in large organizations for application delivery and network traffic management, making them attractive targets. Despite no reports of active exploitation, the potential damage warrants urgent action from users to mitigate risks and ensure service continuity.

### 3. What Actions Should Be Taken?

Organizations using affected LoadMaster and MT Hypervisor versions should immediately apply the add-on patch provided by Progress Software to address the vulnerability. Additionally, they should adhere to any recommended security hardening measures to further protect their systems. For those using the free version of LoadMaster, alternative mitigations or upgrading to a supported version should be considered. System administrators should maintain heightened vigilance, monitor for any unusual activity, and keep abreast of any further updates or patches released by Progress Software.
