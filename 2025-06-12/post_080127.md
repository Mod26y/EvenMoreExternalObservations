**What Happened:** Without access to the article content, one can infer from the headline that Agentic AI was a significant topic or key focus at Gartner's Security & Risk Management (SRM) Summit. Agentic AI likely represents autonomous AI systems capable of making independent decisions without human intervention. The summit might have discussed the capabilities, risks, and potential applications of such AI technologies in the context of cybersecurity and risk management.

**Why It Matters:** The rise of Agentic AI is crucial because it could dramatically transform how cybersecurity threats are managed. If AI can autonomously detect and respond to threats, the speed and efficiency of mitigating potential security incidents could increase. However, AI's autonomy poses significant risks if these systems make incorrect decisions or are manipulated by malicious actors. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of Agentic AI is essential for preparing defenses against its possible misuse and leveraging its advantages for cybersecurity.

**Actions to Be Taken:** Organizations should evaluate the integration of AI, particularly autonomous systems, into their cybersecurity strategies, balancing the potential efficiency gains with adequate oversight mechanisms to prevent unintentional risks. Encouraging ongoing education and discussion within the IT team about both the benefits and vulnerabilities associated with Agentic AI will help in developing robust security postures. Collaborating with industry experts and attending events like the Gartner SRM Summit would provide valuable insights and foresight into managing AI-driven technologies effectively.
