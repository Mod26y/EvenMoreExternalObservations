In this phishing campaign, the cybercrime gang Storm-2657 is targeting university HR employees in the U.S. to reroute salary payments. They use sophisticated social engineering via phishing emails to steal MFA codes, grant access to email accounts, and manipulate payroll configurations. The threat actors also establish persistence by enrolling their phone numbers as MFA devices and further distributing phishing emails to expand their reach among university networks, exploiting vulnerabilities in security practices rather than platform weaknesses.

This attack highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures in educational institutions, which are targeted due to potentially lax security practices and the high volume of financial transactions. Storm-2657's tactics underscore the vulnerability of systems lacking phishing-resistant MFA and the ability of attackers to bypass existing security infrastructure through social engineering. Addressing these phishing threats is important to protect financial resources and maintain institutional credibility and operational integrity.

Educational institutions and associated organizations should consider adopting phishing-resistant MFA across all platforms to protect against similar attacks. Regular training on recognizing phishing attempts and immediate reporting can also significantly reduce successful compromises. Institutions might benefit from revisiting and enhancing their cybersecurity frameworks, possibly incorporating AI-powered breach and attack simulation for ongoing vulnerability assessments. Collaborating with security experts, such as Microsoft's guidance, can provide further insights and aid in fortifying defenses.
