1) What happened: Microsoft has introduced a new feature to the Windows 11 Store on the web that allows users to create and use a multi-app install package, similar to the third-party app Ninite. This feature simplifies the process of setting up a new PC by enabling the simultaneous installation of multiple applications from a single executable installer. Currently, this functionality only works through the web Store and is limited to a curated list of 64 apps from which users can choose a maximum of 16 apps per package.

2) Why it matters: This enhancement to the Microsoft Store streamlines software installation on Windows 11, especially beneficial for users setting up new systems. By reducing the manual effort and time spent on downloading and installing apps individually, it offers a significant improvement in user experience and efficiency. This development might also impact third-party multi-app installers by providing a native Windows solution which could foreseeably expand beyond the initial 64 curated apps, thus reflecting Microsoft's effort to consolidate software management within its ecosystem.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations, particularly those managing large numbers of devices, may consider integrating this new feature into their Windows deployment procedures to enhance operational efficiency. IT departments should monitor updates from Microsoft regarding the feature's support for additional apps or integration into the Windows 11 Store app. Additionally, it's wise to evaluate how this feature compares with existing application deployment tools and determine if it aligns with the organization’s IT strategy, possibly providing feedback to Microsoft for further enhancements.
