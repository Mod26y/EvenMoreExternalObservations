**What happened:** A Windows 11 update, specifically build 26100.3194 with the KB5051987 February update, is causing connection errors for users restoring data from Veeam Recovery Media. These issues primarily affect the Veeam Agent for Windows, which is unable to establish connections while attempting data recovery from a backup server or an SMB network share. The problem manifests as various error messages indicating connection and procedural call failures. As a temporary remedy, affected users are advised to utilize Veeam Recovery Media from earlier Windows 11 builds.

**Why it matters:** This issue impacts a wide range of users, including organizations relying on Veeam products for crucial data backup and recovery processes. Veeam serves a significant number of businesses, including a large portion of the Fortune 500, which means stability in these operations is vital. Connection errors during data recovery can lead to increased downtime, data loss risks, and operational disruptions, potentially affecting service delivery and customer trust in affected businesses.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations affected by these connection errors should use Veeam Recovery Media from an earlier Windows 11 build for immediate recovery needs, as recommended by Veeam, until a comprehensive fix is available. IT departments should monitor for updates from both Microsoft and Veeam regarding permanent solutions. Additionally, businesses should review and possibly enhance their data backup and recovery plans to include contingencies for software update-related issues, ensuring business continuity. Regularly testing recovery processes against different scenarios can help mitigate future risks.
