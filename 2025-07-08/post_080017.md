The CitrixBleed2 vulnerability (CVE-2025-5777) affects Citrix NetScaler ADC and Gateway devices, allowing attackers to steal user session tokens by exploiting a flaw when malformed POST requests are sent during login attempts. The vulnerability, which reveals uninitialized memory data, is similar to a previously exploited Citrix flaw used by ransomware groups. Despite Citrix claiming the flaw isn't actively exploited, cybersecurity researchers and third-party reports contradict this, noting session hijacking activities since mid-June. Public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits have been released, making the threat more imminent and accessible to malicious actors.

This vulnerability poses a critical risk to organizations that rely on Citrix NetScaler for managing user sessions and access to network resources. Successful exploitation can result in unauthorized access, session hijacking, and data breaches, potentially leading to significant operational disruptions and reputational damage. The presence of public PoC exploits amplifies the urgency, as it lowers the barrier for attackers, increasing the likelihood of exploitation, particularly against unpatched systems.

Organizations using Citrix NetScaler ADC or Gateway should prioritize applying the security patches released by Citrix to address this vulnerability. It's also advisable to review Netscaler logs for indicators of compromise (IoCs) and suspicious activity, such as repeated POST requests. Terminating active ICA and PCoIP sessions should be considered only after auditing them for anomalies. Furthermore, cybersecurity teams should enhance monitoring of network traffic and endpoints for unusual behaviors consistent with the exploitation patterns detailed by researchers.
