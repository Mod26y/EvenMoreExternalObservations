1) What happened:

Fortinet has addressed a critical security vulnerability in its Wireless LAN Manager (FortiWLM) software, identified as CVE-2023-34990, which could lead to unauthenticated sensitive information disclosure. This vulnerability, when exploited in tandem with another previously patched vulnerability (CVE-2023-48782), could allow remote code execution (RCE) by enabling attackers to access authenticated endpoints and execute commands with elevated privileges. The issue stems from inadequate input validation, allowing directory traversal and log file access, where attackers can obtain session IDs and potentially gain unauthorized access to the system.

2) Why it matters:

This vulnerability is particularly significant due to its potential for severe exploitation, allowing attackers to perform RCE, a critical threat capable of compromising entire networks. Fortinet is renowned for being a frequent cyberattack target, meaning that vulnerabilities in its products are particularly attractive to cybercriminals. The existence of verbose logs that include session IDs further amplifies the risk. If unpatched systems are exploited, attackers could gain access to sensitive data and disrupt operations, causing significant reputational, financial, and operational damage to organizations.

3) What actions should be taken:

To mitigate the risk, administrators should prioritize updating their FortiWLM systems to versions 8.6.6 or above, or 8.5.5 or above, where this vulnerability has been patched. It's important to review system configurations and implement strong input validation controls to prevent similar vulnerabilities. Conducting regular audits and penetration tests can also help identify other potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, organizations should consistently monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and ensure robust backup systems are in place to restore affected systems promptly in case of an attack. Engaging users in cybersecurity awareness training could further strengthen organizational security posture.
