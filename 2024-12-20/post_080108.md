A critical vulnerability has been identified in Apache Struts 2, a Java application framework widely embedded in legacy systems. Known as CVE-2024-53677, this issue involves a flaw in the File Upload Interceptor, potentially allowing remote code execution via path traversal. Due to complexities in updating older systems and the lack of automated development processes in such environments, the vulnerability presents a significant risk as exploitation may persist for weeks. This echoes a previous vulnerability, CVE-2023-50164, indicating inadequate patch solutions and further complexities in managing outdated tech components.

This vulnerability matters because of its widespread presence in legacy systems across industries like finance, insurance, and government, which are often slow to modernize due to regulatory constraints. Its historical significance is underscored by its link to major breaches, such as the 2017 Equifax incident. The challenge is compounded by technical debt, wherein organizations are running unsupported versions of Struts 2. The complexity involved in patching the vulnerability due to architectural changes makes immediate remediation difficult and increases the urgency of addressing it.

Organizations should conduct a comprehensive inventory of systems to identify and prioritize Apache Struts 2 instances. Immediate action should involve upgrading to at least version 6.4.0, which includes an alternative to the vulnerable interceptor. This requires thorough code rewrites and configuration adjustments. Emphasis should be placed on developing robust attack surface management and lifecycle strategies, ensuring frameworks are regularly updated or replaced with more secure options. Additionally, increased vigilance through monitoring for active exploitation attempts during the interim vulnerability period is crucial.
