The article details a zero-day vulnerability in the NTLM authentication protocol used by Windows versions from 7 to Windows 11. It allows attackers to easily exploit user credentials by merely having a user view a malicious file. The vulnerability has been reported by ACROS Security, marking the second NTLM credential leak they've discovered recently. Microsoft is aware of the issue and plans to release a fix in April, as researchers advise against detailed disclosure until a patch is available. This report highlights continued vulnerabilities within legacy protocol systems like NTLM, underscoring its weaknesses.

The disclosed vulnerability is significant as it affects a widely-used authentication protocol and enables credential theft with minimal user interaction. With NTLM being a legacy protocol still active for backward compatibility, its exploitation could lead to unauthorized network access and potential data breaches. Awareness of such vulnerabilities emphasizes the need for updated security policies and protocols. Realizing the frequency at which NTLM is targeted, organizations need to prioritize threat mitigation and pursue updated, secure authentication methods.

In response to this vulnerability, organizations should review Microsoft's latest guidance to mitigate NTLM relay attacks, and consider implementing Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA) across LDAP, AD CS, and Exchange Server. Frequently reviewing and updating security protocols can also mitigate exposure to such vulnerabilities. Additionally, utilizing third-party security patches, like those from ACROS Security, could provide interim protection for older unsupported software. Phasing out legacy protocols and adopting more secure authentication solutions may reduce the risk of future credential theft, safeguarding organizational data integrity.
