1) What happened:

Microsoft has issued a block on the Windows 11 version 24H2 upgrade for users with outdated installations of Google Workspace Sync for Microsoft Outlook (GWSMO). This action was taken because outdated GWSMO versions are causing launch failures in Outlook, which generates errors that prevent the application from opening. Users affected by this issue must update GWSMO to version 4.3.68.0, released on November 22, 2023, to resolve the problem. Microsoft deployed a compatibility hold tied to safeguard ID 54318776 on these devices to prevent affected users from upgrading until the issue is addressed.

2) Why it matters:

This issue emphasizes the importance of maintaining updated software for seamless operations and security. The blocked upgrades prevent potential disruptions and maintain business continuity by averting malfunctioning email clients, which are critical for organizational communication. Additionally, it highlights the necessity for companies to foresee compatibility issues with essential tools during operating system upgrades. Such issues could lead to unintended operational downtime and productivity loss, emphasizing the need for businesses to consider dependency alignments in their update strategies.

3) What actions should be taken:

Organizations should promptly ensure that all installations of Google Workspace Sync are upgraded to version 4.3.68.0 before attempting the Windows 11 24H2 upgrade. IT departments should communicate with users about the potential issue and the necessary update steps. Monitoring should be put into place to ensure all devices comply with these updates. Furthermore, there should be preparation to reach out to Google Workspace Support if safeguard holds persist. Regular reviews of software compatibility and upgrade impacts should also become part of the organizationâ€™s standard operating procedures to prevent similar issues.
