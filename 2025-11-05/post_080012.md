**1) What happened:**

Threat actors are exploiting a critical vulnerability in the Post SMTP WordPress plugin, installed on over 400,000 sites, allowing them to hijack admin accounts. This vulnerability, CVE-2025-11833, received a critical severity score of 9.8 and affects all plugin versions up to 3.6.0. The flaw arises from missing authorization checks in the plugin's email logging function, enabling attackers to read logged emails, including password reset links. Exploitation began on November 1 following the disclosure and patch by Wordfence. Despite the release of version 3.6.1, at least 210,000 sites remain vulnerable.

**2) Why it matters:**

This vulnerability is significant because it grants attackers unauthorized control over WordPress sites by allowing them to reset admin passwords and gain full site access. With over 400,000 sites potentially affected, the scope of possible damage is extensive, affecting not only the sites' integrity and security but also potentially damaging user trust and operational continuity. Such breaches can lead to data loss, defacement, and further attacks on users or connected systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust security practices and timely updates in the WordPress ecosystem.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Website administrators using the Post SMTP plugin should promptly update to version 3.6.1 or consider temporarily disabling the plugin until updated. Regularly monitoring security advisories and ensuring timely application of updates is crucial to mitigate such risks. Maintaining an inventory of installed plugins and verifying their security status can prevent similar issues. Additionally, users should implement security measures like two-factor authentication for admin accounts, ensure regular backups, and engage in continuous monitoring for suspicious activities to enhance the overall security posture of their sites.
