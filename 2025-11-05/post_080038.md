Microsoft announced the phasing out of Defender Application Guard (MDAG) from Office by December 2027, initiating with the February 2026 release of Office version 2602. MDAG, available to Windows 10 and 11 Enterprise users, isolates Office files in a secure container, protecting systems from potential threats. Its deprecation started in November 2023, and official support is slated to end in April 2024. Post-removal, Office documents will open in Protected View, reducing editing capabilities to bolster security.

This transition matters as it signifies a shift in Microsoft's strategy for securing enterprise environments against malicious documents. MDAG's removal highlights the growing reliance on alternative security solutions like Defender for Endpoint ASR rules and Windows Defender Application Control. The move ensures protection continuity while aligning with changes in Windows 11 support, simplifying the user experience without compromising security. Organizations using Microsoft 365 need to pay attention to this shift to maintain robust security postures.

In response, IT administrators should transition to using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint ASR rules and Windows Defender Application Control to preserve enterprise security standards. They might also consider revisiting security protocols to ensure that updated practices align with Microsoft's new recommended solutions. Engaging in pilot tests for Protected View and the recommended configurations on small user groups could affirm their efficacy before broader deployment. Regularly reviewing and updating devices in preparation for these changes can safeguard from potential vulnerabilities arising during the transition period.
