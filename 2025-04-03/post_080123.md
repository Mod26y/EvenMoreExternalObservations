The article "How an Interdiction Mindset Can Help Win War on Cyberattacks" likely discusses applying an interdiction approach to enhance cybersecurity strategies, focusing on intercepting and thwarting cyber threats before they cause harm. This proactive mindset involves anticipating attacks, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and deploying robust defenses to prevent breaches. By shifting from a reactive to a preventive stance, organizations can better safeguard their systems against evolving threats, reducing the frequency and impact of attacks.
