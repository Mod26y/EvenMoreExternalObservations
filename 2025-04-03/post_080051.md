**What happened:**  
Microsoft has introduced hotpatching support for Windows 11 Enterprise 24H2 customers. This new functionality allows security updates to be installed in the background without rebooting devices, by patching the in-memory code of active processes. Organizations can manage and deploy these updates via a hotpatch-enabled quality update policy through Microsoft Intune. This feature is initially available on x64 devices, with Arm64 support still in public preview. Hotpatching is designed to minimize user disruption while maintaining security by issuing updates quarterly without a required reboot, aligning with the rhythm of standard update cycles.

**Why it matters:**  
The introduction of hotpatching can significantly enhance the cybersecurity posture of organizations using Windows 11 Enterprise by providing timely security updates with minimal operational disruption. This is particularly relevant in enterprise environments where unplanned reboots can impact productivity and critical operations. By ensuring security patches are applied consistently and efficiently, organizations decrease their vulnerability window to cyberattacks, thus fortifying their defenses against evolving threats and maintaining compliance with security best practices.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations should evaluate their eligibility and system readiness for leveraging hotpatching by ensuring they have the necessary Microsoft subscriptions and hardware capabilities. IT administrators should configure and deploy hotpatch-enabled quality update policies via the Microsoft Intune console to optimize their update management processes. By implementing hotpatching, organizations can enhance their proactive defense strategies, align with modern security management practices, and regularly review the compatibility of their devices to maintain efficient security update rollouts without service disruptions.
