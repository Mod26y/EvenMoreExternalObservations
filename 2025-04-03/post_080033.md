**What Happened:**  
A security vulnerability in Verizon’s Call Filter feature allowed users to exploit an unsecured API, enabling them to access incoming call logs of another Verizon Wireless subscriber. Discovered by security researcher Evan Connelly, the flaw was temporarily unaddressed, risking unauthorized access to sensitive call data. The vulnerability arose from improper verification of the JWT payload, which failed to ensure that the phone number in the request matched the one associated with the call data being retrieved.

**Why It Matters:**  
This incident is significant as it exposed private call logs, posing potential risks to individuals, especially high-value targets like politicians, journalists, or law enforcement agents. These logs could be used to trace someone’s daily routine, relationships, or sources, effectively constituting a privacy breach and surveillance risk. Such vulnerabilities undermine trust in telecom security and highlight the critical need for stringent data protection measures and better API security practices.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**  
Verizon should conduct a thorough security audit of all APIs and enhance JWT verification processes to prevent similar vulnerabilities. Implementing strict rate limiting and adopting an API gateway could mitigate risks of mass data scraping. Additionally, expanding communication practices by disclosing incident details transparently would reinforce trust and accountability. Organizations should also foster security partnerships to regularly assess third-party vendor compliance with stringent data protection standards. Educating users on cybersecurity hygiene and potential risks could further enhance overall data safety.
