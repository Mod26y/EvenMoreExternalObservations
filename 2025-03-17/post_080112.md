**1) What happened?**

A week-long outage impacted Microsoft Exchange Online, leading to email delays and failures globally. The incident, traced as EX1027675, was caused by a code issue from a recent service update. Users experienced Non-Delivery Reports citing a "554 5.6.0 Corrupt message content" error and issues with sending emails, particularly those with attachments. Microsoft provided a temporary workaround by suggesting attachments be sent as ZIP files. Although EX1027675 was mitigated, a similar problem, tracked as EX1030895, continued, resulting in additional email delivery challenges that Microsoft is actively working to resolve.

**2) Why it matters?**

The outage underscores the critical dependence on Microsoft Exchange Online for email communication by numerous organizations worldwide, making any disruption significant. Reliable email service is vital for operational continuity, efficient communication, and maintaining business operations. Persistent outages could affect an organizationâ€™s productivity, reputation, and stakeholder trust. Moreover, without transparent communication about the scope and causes of such issues, organizations might struggle to implement contingency plans effectively during similar future disruptions.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Organizations are advised to regularly monitor Microsoft 365 Admin Center for service issues and maintain open communication with IT teams about ongoing service disruptions. Implementing alternative communication methods and having contingency plans, such as backup email systems or non-dependence on a single provider, can mitigate downtime risks. Regular incident response drills could enhance readiness for potential outages. Reviewing contracts and service level agreements with Microsoft may also ensure clarity on support and compensation in the case of prolonged issues. Lastly, keeping abreast of official updates and applying recommended workarounds promptly could minimize business impact.
