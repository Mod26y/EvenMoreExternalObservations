In this cybersecurity event, cybercriminals promoted malicious OAuth applications mimicking Adobe and DocuSign to deceive Microsoft 365 users into granting them permissions, subsequently leading to credential theft and malware distribution. Invoking less sensitive permissions helped them avoid detection. Proofpoint researchers discovered these campaigns which mainly targeted industries such as government and healthcare in the US and Europe, using compromised email accounts for the initial phishing. Post-authorization, users were led through redirect chains ending on phishing or malware-hosting pages.

This attack is significant as it highlights the persistent vulnerability in OAuth application permissions, allowing attackers to gain initial foothold without directly stealing credentials. The abuse of OAuth highlights a broader security risk, as many organizations rely heavily on cloud services like Microsoft 365. Even limited information, such as user profiles and email addresses, can be leveraged for more personalized and effective follow-up attacks, increasing the danger to organizationsâ€™ data security.

To mitigate such threats, organizations should educate their users about the risks and encourage them to verify OAuth app permissions rigorously. Regular audits of approved applications can identify and revoke unauthorized ones. IT departments could also consider restricting the ability of users to consent to third-party apps by configuring settings in Microsoft 365 to prevent unauthorized access. Staying current with OAuth app threats and reinforcing best practices around app consent can substantially reduce vulnerabilities.
