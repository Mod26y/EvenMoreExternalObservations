**1) What happened:**  
The Retail and Hospitality Information Sharing and Analysis Center (RH-ISAC) has launched the LinkSECURE program, a new initiative dedicated to enhancing the cybersecurity capabilities of vendors within the retail and hospitality sectors. The program aims to mitigate third-party risks among RH-ISAC members by fortifying the cyber defenses of their suppliers. LinkSECURE offers support through security control implementation, educational sessions, and access to sector-specific threat intelligence. The focus is on guiding suppliers to enhance their cybersecurity maturity while providing resources for defending against prevalent cyber threats.

**2) Why it matters:**  
The launch of LinkSECURE underscores the critical need to address supply chain vulnerabilities, which have become a major vector for cyberattacks. Strengthening third-party cybersecurity is crucial given that a breach in vendor security can compromise entire organizational ecosystems. By enhancing the cyber resilience of suppliers, RH-ISAC aims to safeguard the retail and hospitality sectors against evolving cyber threats, thereby maintaining consumer trust and preventing significant operational disruptions. This initiative highlights the importance of a collaborative approach in building a robust cybersecurity posture across interconnected industries.

**3) What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations within the retail and hospitality sectors should consider participating in the LinkSECURE program to bolster their supply chain security. Engaging with RH-ISAC can provide critical insights into sector-specific threats and best practices. Additionally, companies are encouraged to evaluate their vendor management strategies, ensuring third-party cybersecurity is a key consideration. Continuous learning through educational sessions and threat intelligence sharing can help businesses remain vigilant and adaptive to emerging threats. Non-member organizations should explore joining RH-ISAC to benefit from its resources and collaborative network.
