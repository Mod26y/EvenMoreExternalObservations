1) **What happened**:
A novel malware campaign has surfaced, locking users in kiosk mode on their web browsers to steal Google credentials. The malware, employing the Amadey loader, "locks" the browser on Google's login page, disabling typical exit methods like the "ESC" and "F11" keys. Frustrated users may enter their credentials to "unlock" their computer, subsequently saving them in the browser. These saved credentials are then harvested by StealC, an information-stealing malware, and transmitted to attackers.

2) **Why it matters**:
This attack method is significant because it exploits user frustration and leverages a typically benign feature—kiosk mode—for malicious purposes. Google credentials often provide access to highly sensitive personal and professional information, making them valuable targets for attackers. This form of malware could easily be adapted or expanded to other types of credential theft or broader attack vectors, heightening the overall cybersecurity threat landscape. Organizations should be particularly concerned as compromised Google accounts could lead to broader breaches within corporate networks.

3) **What actions should be taken**:
Awareness and education are critical. Organizations should inform employees about this specific attack method, emphasizing the importance of not entering credentials when suspicious behavior is noted. Regular training on recognizing phishing attacks and unusual system behavior should be conducted. It's also wise to implement robust endpoint protection that can detect and mitigate such malware. Regularly updated multi-factor authentication (MFA) can add an extra layer of security. Finally, having clear incident response procedures in place, including steps for isolating and cleaning infected machines, will help mitigate the impact of a compromise if it occurs.
