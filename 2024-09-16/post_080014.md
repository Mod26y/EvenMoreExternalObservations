1) **What happened:**
The FBI and CISA issued a public service announcement warning that false claims are being spread about U.S. voter registration data being compromised in cyberattacks. Malicious actors are presenting publicly accessible voter data as evidence of hacking, aiming to manipulate public opinion and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions. The agencies clarified that accessing publicly available voter registration data does not constitute a breach of election infrastructure and highlighted there is no evidence of any cyberattacks affecting the integrity of U.S. elections.

2) **Why it matters:**
This issue is significant because misinformation could undermine the publicâ€™s confidence in the democratic process, potentially lowering voter turnout, and eroding trust in election outcomes. Disinformation efforts can create unnecessary panic and skepticism, which foreign actors may exploit to destabilize democracies. Ensuring that the public understands the distinction between publicly accessible data and actual hacking of voting infrastructure is crucial for preserving electoral integrity and maintaining trust in the democratic process, especially as key elections approach.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
The steering committee should prioritize enhancing public awareness about the secure nature of U.S. elections and correct misinformation. This can be done through timely communication campaigns emphasizing the reliability of official sources and channels for election-related information. Training staff to recognize and address false claims rapidly is essential. Collaboration with local election officials to amplify accurate information will help; regularly monitored ".gov" domains should be cited as credible sources. Encouraging the public to question unverified claims and adopt a cautious approach to information on social media platforms will further support these efforts.
