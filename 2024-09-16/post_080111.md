**1) What happened:**

The article highlights a recent finding from the 2024 Data Health Check report by Databarracks, revealing that over half of organizations experienced cyber threats in the past year. A significant impact of these incidents is job loss, with 37% of surveyed IT, resilience, and cybersecurity professionals reporting layoffs resulting from cyber-attacks. Larger firms are particularly vulnerable, as they are five times more likely to suffer from data loss and downtime due to these attacks.

**2) Why it matters:**

This issue is crucial as it underscores the profound human impact of cyber-attacks, which were previously viewed primarily as financial and operational challenges. The revelation that cyber-attacks can lead to substantial job losses, affecting not only IT and security staff but potentially resulting in wider business disruptions, highlights the far-reaching consequences. It affects employee well-being and job security, making cyber resilience and employee training paramount to organizational stability and productivity.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

Organizations may consider revisiting and enhancing their cybersecurity measures and resilience strategies. Investing in comprehensive employee training programs to raise cybersecurity awareness can help mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks. Additionally, maintaining open communication channels about incident impacts with all staff can bolster morale and clarity during and after cyber incidents. Developing a well-rounded crisis response plan that includes support for affected employees and clear roles for IT and security teams can also contribute to reducing the risk of job losses following cyber-attacks.
