1) **What happened:**
The premiere of a documentary titled "Do We Belong Here?", which highlights the experiences of women and other underrepresented groups in the cybersecurity industry, took place at the Tampa Theatre. The event was organized by Cyber Florida at USF in partnership with Cisco and WiCyS and saw participation from over 200 community members. The documentary is an extension of the "Do We Belong Here?" podcast and features stories of perseverance and success from leading female cybersecurity professionals.

2) **Why it matters:**
The event and documentary are significant because they shed light on the underrepresentation of women and minorities in the cybersecurity workforce, which currently stands at only 20-25%. Highlighting these stories fosters diversity and inclusion in an industry that is crucial for national security and technological advancement. Increasing diversity within cybersecurity can lead to a broader range of perspectives and solutions, thereby enhancing innovation and problem-solving within the field.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
Organizations should consider hosting similar events and discussions that promote diversity and inclusion within their own cybersecurity teams. Educational institutions and industry leaders might use the documentary as a resource to inspire and mentor new entrants from underrepresented groups. Moreover, fostering partnerships with organizations like WiCyS can help in building networks and support systems for women and minorities in cybersecurity. Extending outreach and recruitment efforts to diverse talent pools can also help in addressing the current underrepresentation in the industry.
