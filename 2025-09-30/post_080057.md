1) Due to access limitations, detailed content from the article cannot be directly reviewed; however, the title and source suggest that the article discusses ongoing issues with IoT (Internet of Things) security. "Flounders" and "Churning Risk" imply persistent vulnerabilities and evolving threats impacting IoT devices. This often involves inadequate security measures and continuous emergence of new risks due to the proliferation and integration of IoT in various sectors.

2) The issue is significant due to the proliferation of IoT devices across critical infrastructure, industry, and personal settings. IoT devices, often with limited built-in security, present an attractive target for cybercriminals, offering potential entry points into larger networks. The impact extends beyond data breaches to potential physical safety implications, particularly in healthcare, transportation, and smart city deployments.

3) Organizations may consider strengthening IoT security by conducting comprehensive risk assessments, implementing robust device management policies, and ensuring that security is a primary consideration in the procurement and deployment of IoT devices. Maintaining up-to-date firmware and adopting network segmentation can also mitigate risks. Awareness and training initiatives can help ensure entities manage IoT ecosystems securely.
