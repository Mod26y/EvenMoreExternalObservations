1) What happened:

OpenAI is reportedly testing new social media-like features within ChatGPT, specifically direct messaging capabilities, referencing a feature codenamed "Calpico." This would potentially allow ChatGPT users to send messages directly to each other, much like traditional social media platforms. Evidence of these features has been found in the ChatGPT Android app, with similar functionalities already present in OpenAI's Sora 2 iOS app. These updates suggest an upcoming increase in interactivity among users, including username support, profile customization, and notifications.

2) Why it matters:

This development expands ChatGPT's role beyond being a simple conversational AI model. By incorporating social media features, OpenAI is creating a more interconnected and engaging user ecosystem. This not only potentially increases user retention and engagement but also introduces new vectors for cybersecurity risks, such as privacy concerns related to messaging and user data. Moreover, these features could lead to a richer data collection landscape, useful for honing AI- driven interactions, but also demanding heightened cybersecurity vigilance.

3) What actions should be taken:

Organizations, especially those integrating or involved with AI platforms like ChatGPT, should consider the potential security implications of these social features. Conduct thorough risk assessments and bolster data protection policies to safeguard user privacy. Furthermore, comprehensive security measures should be implemented to prevent unauthorized data access and ensure secure communication channels. Staying informed about updates and changes within AI platforms can also help in anticipating and mitigating possible risks associated with new technologies and features.
