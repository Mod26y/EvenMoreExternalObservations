### What Happened
Recently, CDK Global, a leading provider of SaaS for the automotive retail industry, suffered a cyberattack possibly linked to the East European ransomware group BlackSuit. This attack disrupted operations for approximately 15,000 automotive dealers, forcing them to revert to manual processes. CDK informed affected companies of a multi-day restoration timeline, although subsequent efforts were hampered by a second attack. The incident rendered key systems offline and affected operations for prominent companies like Penske and Lithia Motors.

### Why It Matters
The CDK Global attack underscores the critical vulnerability that comes with heavy reliance on SaaS providers, particularly in essential sectors like automotive retail. Such disruptions highlight the broader risks associated with the software supply chain and the potential for widespread economic and operational impact. Moreover, the incident brings attention to the evolving tactics of cyber adversaries who now leverage attacks to compound and exploit recovery attempts. This accentuates the urgency for organizations to assess their dependencies and enhances the importance of robust contingency planning and prompt incident response measures.

### Actions to be Taken
Organizations should rigorously review and bolster their cybersecurity frameworks, focusing on multi-faceted risk management strategies. This includes diversifying vendor relationships to mitigate risks and implementing stringent security assessments and contractual obligations for cybersecurity standards with their SaaS providers. Collaborative threat intelligence sharing and best practices within industry sectors can also enhance collective defenses. Additionally, an immediate step would be to audit the contingency plans, ensuring they encompass proactive defense measures, continuous assessment, and comprehensive response readiness, taking lessons from CDK's recovery struggles to avoid fast-track restoration vulnerabilities.
