**1) What happened?**

Google is testing a new feature called the "Digital Credential API" for Chrome on Android. This feature allows websites to securely request and obtain identity information such as driver's licenses and passports stored in users' mobile wallets. The Digital Credential API leverages Android's IdentityCredential system to safely facilitate the transfer of identity documents, enabling websites to verify user identities without the need for manual document uploads.

**2) Why it matters**

This development is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it represents a shift towards implementing more secure and streamlined methods for verifying user identity online, reducing the reliance on less secure practices like manual document uploads. Secondly, it potentially enhances user privacy by ensuring only necessary data is shared and giving users control over what information is disclosed. In contexts where identity verification is crucial, such as financial services and government applications, this feature could improve both user experience and security. The move aligns with broader trends towards digitizing traditional paper-based documents, accommodating regulatory demands like eIDAS and age verification regulations.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information**

Information security steering committees should consider evaluating this emerging feature's potential impact on their security protocols and user identity verification processes. It may be prudent to stay updated on Google's progress and prepare to educate users about managing their digital credentials securely. Furthermore, they might explore policy adjustments and integration options. The committee should also review current methods for secure data exchange and potentially leverage this new API's benefits to enhance privacy and security in online interactions. Collaborating with legal and compliance teams to understand the regulatory implications would be a proactive step.
