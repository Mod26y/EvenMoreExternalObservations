**1. What happened:**

The FBI has issued a warning about cybercriminals posing as law firms and legal professionals, offering fraudulent cryptocurrency recovery services to victims of investment scams. These scammers build trust by claiming affiliations with government agencies and referencing legitimate financial institutions. They typically request personal or banking information, upfront fees, or back taxes for their supposed services. Victims of these recovery scams have collectively lost over $9 million between February 2023 and February 2024 according to the FBIâ€™s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).

**2. Why it matters:**

This alert highlights a growing trend in secondary scams targeting victims already harmed by initial crypto fraud. The scammers not only deepen the financial loss but also misuse the victims' sensitive personal and banking information, potentially leading to further fraud or identity theft. Such activities undermine trust in legitimate recovery efforts, making it harder for real law enforcement agencies to assist victims. Awareness of these deceptive practices is critical for safeguarding individuals and maintaining confidence in digital financial systems.

**3. What actions should be taken:**

To mitigate the risk, individuals and organizations should exercise extreme caution when approached by entities claiming to offer recovery services, especially if they request personal information or fees. Researching such companies thoroughly online before engaging with them is prudent. Filing any suspicions or incidents with the IC3 portal can assist law enforcement in tracking these fraudsters. Moreover, enhancing community and employee awareness about these scams can reduce the chances of falling victim to such schemes. Collaborating with cybersecurity professionals to monitor for suspicious activities and educate stakeholders about secure practices is also advisable.
