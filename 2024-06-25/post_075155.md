### What Happened

An analysis revealed the successful mitigation of 70,000 security vulnerabilities in citizen-developed applications within 90 days by a small team of two individuals. This massive number of vulnerabilities originated from low-code/no-code platforms, like Microsoft Power Platform, which are widely adopted for business-critical applications developed by non-professional, "citizen" developers. The complexities and scale of citizen development present unique challenges that are being addressed through robust, automated AppSec programs designed to accommodate rapid, decentralized software development.

### Why It Matters

The rise in citizen development significantly impacts cybersecurity, given that these non-professional developers often create numerous applications without a strong security focus. This increases the attack surface and introduces significant vulnerabilities into the organization's IT ecosystem. Addressing the security gaps in these applications is crucial for maintaining the overall security posture of the enterprise. The successful mitigation in the case study highlights the necessity of tailored AppSec approaches to handle the unique challenges posed by citizen developers, emphasizing automation, process design, and proper governance.

### Actions to Take

Organizations should consider implementing automated, self-service AppSec programs specifically designed for citizen developers. Start by inventorying all low-code/no-code applications and identifying their owners. Develop clear security policies and risk appetites that guide what applications are permissible. Automate security assessments and retesting of vulnerabilities. Provide a self-service portal that offers documentation and support for citizen developers, and enforce service-level agreements (SLAs) to ensure timely remediation of vulnerabilities. Regularly track and report progress to maintain executive support and continually improve the security measures. Engaging management early and framing the initiative as an enabler rather than an obstacle will facilitate smoother implementation.
