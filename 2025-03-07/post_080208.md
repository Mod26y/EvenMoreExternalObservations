1) **What happened:** The article likely discusses how women have been disproportionately affected by cybersecurity job cutbacks in 2024. This trend might include women being laid off more frequently or facing greater barriers in advancement during organizational restructuring or budget cuts. These cutbacks could stem from broader economic challenges or shifts in organizational priorities, impacting workforce diversity in the cybersecurity field.

2) **Why it matters:** This matter is crucial as it highlights a setback in efforts to ensure diversity and equal opportunity within the cybersecurity industry. A diverse workforce brings varied perspectives and approaches to problem-solving, which is vital for effective security strategies. Unequal cutbacks risk widening the gender gap, slowing progress towards gender parity, and potentially hindering overall organizational effectiveness in managing cybersecurity threats.

3) **What actions should be taken:** Organizations could evaluate their workforce policies to ensure layoffs and hiring practices support diversity and inclusivity. Setting specific goals for maintaining or improving gender balance and monitoring their impact could also be beneficial. Additionally, investing in leadership development and retention programs for women might mitigate disparities. Encouraging mentorship opportunities and creating a supportive work environment can help retain diverse talent during economic downturns.
