**What happened:**   
Armis, a company specializing in asset visibility and security, has acquired OTORIO, a cybersecurity firm known for its operational technology (OT) risk management solutions. This acquisition aims to enhance Armis’ OT exposure management capabilities by integrating OTORIO’s risk management expertise and technologies into its existing platforms. The focus is on providing comprehensive OT security solutions to better protect industrial control systems and critical infrastructure sectors from cyber threats.

**Why it matters:**  
The acquisition is significant as it highlights the growing importance of safeguarding operational technology in industries that rely heavily on critical infrastructure. As cyber threats increasingly target OT environments, enhanced protection and management are crucial to prevent disruptions and potential damage. By expanding its solutions, Armis can offer more robust protection against emerging OT threats, thereby increasing the resilience of essential services and industrial operations. This move reflects the broader trend of prioritizing OT security amid an evolving threat landscape.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations that rely on OT infrastructure should evaluate their current cybersecurity strategies and consider leveraging integrated platforms like the one Armis is developing with OTORIO's technology. It would be beneficial to assess the potential for increased asset visibility and risk mitigation provided by solutions that focus on both IT and OT environments. Additionally, staying informed about industry advancements and diversifying cybersecurity defenses can help organizations stay ahead of potential threats targeting their operational technology.
