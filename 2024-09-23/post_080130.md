### What Happened

A nearly max-critical zero-click vulnerability (CVE-2024-20017) affecting MediaTek Wi-Fi chipsets and driver bundles has been discovered in routers and smartphones from brands such as Ubiquiti, Xiaomi, and Netgear. The vulnerability enables remote code execution (RCE) without user interaction, leading to potential device takeovers. The issue, an out-of-bounds write in a network daemon called wappd, has prompted the release of a public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, heightening the risk. MediaTek SDK versions 7.4.0.1 and earlier, along with OpenWrt 19.07 and 21.02, are all affected, though patches have been made available.

### Why It Matters

This vulnerability's zero-click nature makes it particularly concerning, as it allows attackers to compromise devices without any user interaction, which significantly increases the risk to a vast number of devices. Given the broad usage of MediaTek chipsets across multiple manufacturers, many routers and smartphones are at risk of being taken over remotely, potentially jeopardizing the security and privacy of a large user base. The availability of a public PoC further escalates the urgency, as it lowers the bar for potential attackers to exploit this vulnerability effectively.

### What Actions Should Be Taken

Entities should promptly review their inventory to identify any routers and smartphones using MediaTek chipsets and driver bundles. Applying MediaTek's available patches should be prioritized to mitigate the risk. Additionally, continuous monitoring for unusual network activities can help detect exploitation attempts. Users of OpenWrt should ensure they are running the updated versions that address this vulnerability. Finally, organizations might consider educating their employees and users about the potential risks and advising them to update their devices regularly to stay protected against such vulnerabilities.
