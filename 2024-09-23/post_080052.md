1) **What happened:**
In July, The Walt Disney Company experienced a significant data breach in which a cybercriminal, known as "NullBulge", accessed and stole 1.1TB of data from Disneyâ€™s Slack platform. This stolen data included sensitive information such as project details, financial data, and internal communications from nearly 10,000 Slack channels. Subsequently, Disney decided to discontinue using Slack and began transitioning to other collaboration tools, slated for completion by the end of the next fiscal quarter. Additionally, Disney suffered another similar breach a month prior involving its Confluence server.

2) **Why it matters:**
This incident underscores the vulnerability of internal communication platforms to cyberattacks and the potential catastrophic consequences of data breaches. The exposure of such a vast amount of confidential information can lead to severe financial, operational, and reputational damage. It highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and reinforces the necessity for organizations to continually reassess and update their security protocols. Such breaches also increase the risk of intellectual property theft, loss of competitive advantage, and compliance issues with data protection regulations.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
In light of the Disney data breach involving Slack, it would be prudent for the committee to conduct a comprehensive review of current communication and collaboration tools in use. Evaluate the security measures associated with these platforms and consider transitioning to more secure alternatives if vulnerabilities are identified. Implement stricter access controls, regular security audits, and employee training programs to reduce the risk of credential theft and unauthorized access. Moreover, developing a robust incident response plan to quickly and effectively address potential future breaches is crucial to mitigate damage and maintain trust.
