1) **What Happened:**
Ukraine's National Coordination Centre for Cybersecurity (NCCC) has prohibited the use of the Telegram messaging app within government agencies, military units, and critical infrastructure entities due to heightened national security concerns. This decision, announced on September 19, stems from the fear that Russian intelligence services might access user data and messages on Telegram, posing significant privacy and national security risks. Ukrainian authorities, including Secretary Oleksandr Lytvynenko and Defense Intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov, highlighted the app's vulnerabilities and its use by Russia for various cyberattacks and coordination of attacks.

2) **Why It Matters:**
This measure underscores the critical intersection of cybersecurity and national security, particularly in conflict zones. The restriction of Telegram in Ukraine signals broader concerns about the app's security protocols and potential for exploitation by hostile entities. For the US County's Infosec Steering Committee, this action illustrates the importance of assessing the security risks posed by widely-used communication platforms, especially those with known vulnerabilities or ties to adversarial states. Monitoring application-level threats and making informed decisions on their usage are crucial steps in safeguarding sensitive information and overall organizational security.

3) **What Actions Should Be Taken:**
In response to this information, the County's InfoSec Steering Committee should consider initiating a review of the applications used within its own government and critical infrastructure sectors. Emphasis should be placed on evaluating the security, data privacy, and potential for exploitation by malicious actors. Developing policies and guidelines regarding the approval and usage of communication apps can help mitigate associated risks. Additionally, strengthening cybersecurity awareness and training programs for employees to recognize and report potential threats can enhance overall security posture. Regular audits and updates to security protocols are also advised to adapt to the evolving threat landscape.
