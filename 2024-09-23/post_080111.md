### 1) What happened?

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) introduced the Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) Operational Cybersecurity Alignment (FOCAL) plan to enhance and synchronize the cybersecurity posture across federal agencies. The initiative aims to foster cohesive operational defense capabilities that address current cybersecurity gaps and improve risk management, communication, agility, and resilience across over 100 federal agencies.

### 2) Why it matters

This initiative is crucial as it addresses the wide disparities in cybersecurity maturity and practices among federal agencies, which render them vulnerable to threats despite significant investments in cybersecurity. A cohesive and coordinated cybersecurity posture ensures that federal agencies can better manage and mitigate risks, leading to more robust protection of government services and data. Additionally, it promotes the overall resilience and efficiency of the federal cybersecurity landscape.

### 3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information

Local government entities should consider reviewing and possibly adopting similar alignment strategies to synchronize their cybersecurity efforts across departments. Establishing consistent baseline security practices and fostering inter-departmental communication can enhance overall cyber risk management. Additionally, investing in staff training, resource allocation, and technology deployments to address specific areas like asset management, vulnerability management, and incident response will be essential to achieving these goals. Recognizing the challenges in collaboration and resource allocation will prepare agencies to proactively address these issues.
