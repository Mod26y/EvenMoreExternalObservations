1) **What happened**: Microsoft has announced a public preview of Hotpatching for Windows Server 2025, a feature allowing the installation of security updates without requiring reboots. This technology updates the in-memory code of running processes, facilitating faster installation times, reduced resource usage, and minimizing downtime associated with frequent reboots. Though successful hotpatching minimizes reboot needs, some non-security updates and non-Windows updates still require traditional reboots. Additionally, the public preview is available through Azure Arc, supporting various hardware and virtualization platforms such as Hyper-V and VMware.

2) **Why it matters**: This development is significant because it addresses one of the biggest pain points in IT management: downtime caused by server reboots, especially during critical updates. By reducing the need for reboots from monthly to quarterly, Hotpatching enhances system availability and operational efficiency. This lower downtime will be particularly advantageous for organizations with stringent uptime requirements, such as healthcare, finance, and critical infrastructure. Furthermore, improving security postures by reducing the window of vulnerability through more timely patches can help avert potential cyber threats.

3) **What actions should be taken**: Organizations should begin evaluating the Hotpatching feature in a controlled environment to understand its benefits and limitations. IT departments might consider updating their change management and patching strategies, incorporating Hotpatching where feasible to optimize server availability and security. Ensuring that systems meet the prerequisites for Hotpatching, such as running Windows Server 2025 Datacenter evaluation, having Virtualization Based Security enabled, and connecting machines to Azure Arc, would be essential steps. Additionally, keeping current with traditional patching methods for non-hotpatchable updates remains necessary to maintain comprehensive security coverage.
