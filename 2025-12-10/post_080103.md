1) In the article, Microsoft addressed an exploited zero-day vulnerability as part of its regular Patch Tuesday updates. A zero-day is a previously unknown security flaw that is actively exploited by attackers before a fix is available. This light patch rollout may include essential security patches for systems that could potentially be compromised by this vulnerability.

2) Addressing a zero-day vulnerability is crucial because these flaws are often targeted by attackers seeking to gain unauthorized access to systems. Exploited zero-days can lead to data breaches, system failures, and can severely impact an organization's operations and reputational standing. Timely patches are essential to mitigate these threats.

3) In light of this update, organizations should promptly review and apply security patches provided by Microsoft to protect against potential exploits. It's important to incorporate regular patch management into security protocols and ensure that systems are promptly updated to mitigate vulnerabilities. Additionally, continuous monitoring and threat intelligence gathering can help in pre-emptively identifying potential threats to the organization's infrastructure.
