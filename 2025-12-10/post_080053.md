1) Fortinet has identified and issued patches for two critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719) in its products including FortiOS, FortiWeb, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitchManager. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to bypass FortiCloud SSO authentication through weaknesses in cryptographic signature verification when a device is registered with FortiCare and the FortiCloud SSO login is enabled without manual configuration. Also, there are patches for two other vulnerabilities related to password change and authentication via password hash.

2) This matter is critical due to the longstanding exploitation history of Fortinet vulnerabilities in significant cyber threats, such as zero-day attacks. Fortinet products are widely used in various sectors, and their exposure becomes a significant risk point. Compromised systems can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or espionage. Since FortiCloud SSO login may become enabled during registration, systems can be inadvertently left vulnerable, creating potential entry points for attackers.

3) Organizations using Fortinet products should urgently review and patch their systems to the latest versions addressing these vulnerabilities. Systems administrators are advised to disable the FortiCloud SSO login feature if it is currently enabled and upgrade to a patched version at the earliest opportunity. Regular reviews of system configurations to monitor unauthorized changes, employee training on identifying potential security threats, and employing robust monitoring tools can further strengthen defenses against similar threats.
