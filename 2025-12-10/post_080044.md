Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-december-2025-patch-tuesday-fixes-3-zero-days-57-flaws/

**1) What happened:**  
On Microsoft’s December 2025 Patch Tuesday, a total of 57 vulnerabilities were addressed, including three zero-day vulnerabilities. Of these, one was actively exploited and two were publicly disclosed before being fixed. The update focused on varying vulnerabilities such as elevation of privilege, remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, and spoofing, with significant emphasis on critical remote code execution vulnerabilities. Notably, high-priority patches included fixing an actively exploited privilege elevation vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver and addressing a remote code execution flaw in GitHub Copilot for Jetbrains.

**2) Why it matters:**  
This update is crucial due to the inclusion of zero-day vulnerabilities, especially the actively exploited Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver vulnerability, which could allow attackers to gain SYSTEM privileges illicitly. Zero-days pose significant risks as they are often exploited before a patch is released, making systems highly vulnerable. The broad scope of the flaws can impact a wide range of systems and applications, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruptions. Addressing these issues promptly ensures increased security posture and reduces the risk of compromise across various Microsoft products.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**  
Organizations should promptly apply the latest security updates from Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday to protect their systems from known vulnerabilities, particularly zero-day exploits. IT departments need to prioritize patching critical vulnerabilities such as those affecting privilege elevations and remote code executions, especially in high-risk environments. Additionally, security teams should review and enhance monitoring and detection protocols to identify suspicious activities related to these vulnerabilities. Proper communication should be maintained with end-users regarding new security practices, such as using the -UseBasicParsing switch in PowerShell, to prevent unauthorized code execution.
