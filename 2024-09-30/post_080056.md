It emphasizes that many organizations, despite their preparedness, continue to face breaches because leaders often don't understand their roles and responsibilities when a crisis occurs. This lack of clear roles causes delays and errors in decision-making. The article stresses the need for open communication, predefined roles, and built-in alternatives to manage crises effectively. Some solutions include establishing crisis war rooms, utilizing the PACE model for redundancy, and conducting regular preparedness exercises like tabletop drills.

2) This information is crucial as it highlights that even well-prepared organizations struggle during cyber crises due to unclear roles and lack of timely decision-making. The emphasis on using allies, communication, and pre-emptive planning can significantly reduce the impact of a breach, both in terms of financial loss and reputational damage. Learning how to manage the 'fog of war' feeling and having predefined alternatives can lead to quicker, more effective responses, setting a standard for organizational resilience in the face of cyber threats.

3) To improve crisis management, organizations should clearly define and communicate roles and responsibilities for all stakeholders during a cyber incident. Establishing a secure communication channel, such as a crisis war room, can ensure that accurate information flows quickly. Regularly conducting tabletop exercises and simulations will familiarize the team with crisis protocols and reveal any potential gaps in the response plan. Finally, adopting a PACE model for critical decision-making and redundancy can bolster the organization's ability to respond flexibly and effectively to any cyber threat.
