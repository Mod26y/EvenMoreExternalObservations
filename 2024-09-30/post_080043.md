### What Happened
Millions of Kia vehicles were found to have a security vulnerability that allowed attackers to remotely control the vehicles using just license plate information. Independent security researchers discovered the flaw, which involved the API protocols used for internet-to-vehicle commands. These vulnerabilities allowed unauthorized access to functions such as starting or stopping the engine, locking or unlocking the vehicle, and even accessing the vehicle's location and owner's personal information. The flaw affected Kia model years from 2024 to as far back as 2013 and has since been fixed by Kia after they were alerted to the issue mid-August.

### Why It Matters
This discovery is crucial because it underscores the significant cybersecurity vulnerabilities present in modern connected vehicles. With cars increasingly becoming "smarter" and more connected, they also become more susceptible to remote hack attacks. The incident prompts serious concerns about public safety and privacy, particularly considering that attackers could misuse these vulnerabilities for malicious intents. The case also highlights the broader issue of the automotive industry's apparent lag in implementing stringent cybersecurity measures, which exposes millions of vehicle owners to potential risks.

### Actions To Be Taken
The county's information security steering committee should consider collaborating with relevant agencies to advocate for stronger automotive cybersecurity standards and regulations. Public awareness campaigns can educate vehicle owners about the potential risks and emphasize the importance of software updates. Finally, for county-operated or financed vehicle fleets, a review and potential upgrade of their cybersecurity protocols may help mitigate such risks. Such actions would not necessarily eliminate the threat but would significantly reduce the likelihood of successful cyber-attacks on connected vehicles.
