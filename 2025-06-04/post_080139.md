1) What happened: Google Chrome has decided to stop trusting digital certificates issued by Chunghwa Telecom and Netlock, two certificate authorities. This action indicates that Google found issues that compromise the trustworthiness of these certificates, potentially due to security lapses or violations of certificate authority policies. Certificates are crucial for verifying secure connections between browsers and servers, and losing Googleâ€™s trust implies significant security concerns associated with these certificate providers.

2) Why it matters: This development is significant as it impacts a wide array of websites that rely on certificates from these authorities for secure communication. Users of these sites might encounter security warnings and disruptions in service. This affects not only user experience but also organizational credibility, considering the reliance on trusted digital certificates to secure sensitive data. Organizations using these certificates risk being perceived as insecure if they do not act swiftly.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations using certificates from Chunghwa Telecom and Netlock should conduct an immediate audit of their digital certificates. It is advisable to replace any affected certificates with those from a trusted authority to maintain secure connections and user trust. Furthermore, organizations should continuously monitor their certificate infrastructure and work with their cybersecurity teams to ensure compliance with updated security standards and browser trust requirements to prevent future disruptions.
