On April 25, 2025, a security researcher identified a vulnerability in ExpressVPN's Windows client that led to RDP traffic bypassing the VPN tunnel, inadvertently exposing users' real IP addresses. This flaw, introduced by debug code mistakenly included in production builds, affected versions 12.97 up to 12.101.0.2-beta. The issue only impacted those utilizing the Remote Desktop Protocol, posing a particular concern for IT administrators and remote workers.

This discovery underscores the critical importance of the integrity of VPN services, especially those operated by leading providers like ExpressVPN. Users depend on VPNs for privacy and security; thus, any exposure of IP addresses could compromise user anonymity and potentially reveal their online activities. Although ExpressVPN asserts that the risk was low due to the limited use of RDP by typical users, maintaining trust in VPN services hinges on their ability to prevent such incidents.

As incidents of such nature highlight potential risks, users are advised to update their ExpressVPN Windows client to version 12.101.0.45 or later to mitigate exposure. Organizations relying on RDP should evaluate their security protocols and consider additional protections, like network monitoring, to detect potential anomalies. Moreover, providers like ExpressVPN are enhancing their quality controls and automation to prevent similar issues from recurring, a practice that could benefit all software development processes to increase security assurance.
