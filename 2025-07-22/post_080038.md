Veeam Recovery Orchestrator users experienced login issues with the Web UI after enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA). This problem affected version 7.2.1.286, released between July 8th and July 17th, but has been rectified in version 7.2.1.290. Users who are locked out should contact Veeam's technical support rather than upgrade directly. There is also an unaddressed issue affecting Veeam Recovery Media restores on Windows 11 24H2 systems, likely related to a February Windows update.

This matters as Veeam's recovery solutions are crucial for disaster recovery, and the inability to log into the system could delay recovery efforts in critical situations. Many large organizations rely on Veeam for their recovery plans, and such login issues could lead to prolonged downtime during an incident, impacting business operations significantly. Additionally, the compatibility issue with Windows 11 further complicates recovery processes for organizations using these environments.

Organizations should promptly verify if they are using the affected version. If so, contacting Veeam support should be prioritized to resolve the login issue. Updating to the newest version should follow once cleared by Veeam support. For those on Windows 11 24H2, monitoring updates from Veeam for resolution or workarounds regarding the restore issue is advisable. Regular communication with Veeam and staying informed on subsequent advisories will help enhance system resilience and ensure preparedness in disaster situations.
