1) What happened:

The article discusses the creation and efforts of "Sober in Cyber," founded by Jennifer VanAntwerp in 2023 to provide a sober environment at cybersecurity events. This initiative arose from VanAntwerpâ€™s observation of the pervasive presence of alcohol at such events, which can exclude sober individuals. "Sober in Cyber" hosts alcohol-free gatherings and promotes the inclusion of non-alcoholic options at conferences. This effort is part of a broader "sober curious" movement encouraging mindful alcohol consumption and a recognition of unhealthy drinking habits within the cybersecurity industry.

2) Why it matters:

This initiative is significant as it addresses the mental health and inclusivity challenges within the cybersecurity community. The Tines survey revealed that a notable portion of cybersecurity professionals consume alcohol at potentially unhealthy levels, with 19% drinking more than three drinks daily. By promoting alcohol-free options and environments, "Sober in Cyber" aims to create a more inclusive and supportive culture. This can help reduce social anxiety among non-drinkers and promote healthier lifestyle choices, ultimately fostering a safer and more productive professional environment.

3) What actions should be taken:

The information security steering committee may consider encouraging event organizers to offer non-alcoholic drink options at cybersecurity conferences and gatherings. It might also be beneficial to promote participation in sober networking groups like "Sober in Cyber" to support diverse and inclusive social environments. Additionally, raising awareness about the potential mental health benefits of reducing alcohol consumption could foster a healthier workplace culture where all employees feel valued and included. Incorporating feedback from sober individuals to tailor networking events more inclusively could further bolster these efforts.
