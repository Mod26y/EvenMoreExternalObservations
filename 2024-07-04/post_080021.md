### What Happened

OVHcloud, a prominent global cloud services provider, successfully mitigated a record-breaking distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack earlier this year. The attack reached an unprecedented rate of 840 million packets per second (Mpps). This attack reportedly leveraged compromised MikroTik Cloud Core Router (CCR) devices, which are frequently used for high-performance networking. These devices, running outdated firmware, were exploited through known vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to concentrate massive traffic through a narrow spectrum of internet infrastructure. This attack is part of a larger trend of increasing DDoS attack sizes, with OVHcloud observing attacks exceeding 1 Tbps becoming more common in 2024.

### Why It Matters

This incident underscores a significant escalation in the scale and frequency of DDoS attacks, highlighting vulnerabilities in network infrastructure, particularly compromised MikroTik devices. With more than 100,000 MikroTik devices accessible over the internet, even a small percentage being hijacked can generate attacks reaching billions of packets per second. For large organizations and public entities like a US County, these types of attacks can disrupt critical services, impact public facilities, and incur substantial costs. It emphasizes the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures and the updating of network hardware to prevent exploitation.

### Actions to Be Taken

Organizations should prioritize conducting comprehensive reviews of their networking equipment to ensure all devices are running up-to-date firmware and are not exposed to known vulnerabilities. Network administrators can implement tighter controls on network infrastructure, including regular security audits and monitoring for unusual traffic patterns. Engaging in cooperation with internet service providers and cybersecurity firms can help in the early detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks. Additionally, considering investments in DDoS mitigation services or solutions can provide an extra layer of defense against such large-scale attacks. Regular employee training on cybersecurity best practices can also help in minimizing the human factor in network security.
