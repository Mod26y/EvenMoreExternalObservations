1) **What happened**: A new botnet named Eleven11bot has compromised over 86,000 Internet of Things (IoT) devices like security cameras and network video recorders, primarily to conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Discovered by Nokia researchers, this botnet is notably large among non-state actor operations, with the Shadowserver Foundation confirming infections in several countries, predominantly in the US and UK. The malware spreads by exploiting weak admin credentials and scanning for exposed Telnet and SSH ports, with a significant portion of these activities traced back to IP addresses in Iran.

2) **Why it matters**: The Eleven11botâ€™s scale and rapid growth highlight a significant cybersecurity threat to global internet infrastructure. It emphasizes vulnerabilities within IoT devices, which are commonly overlooked in security practices. As these devices are often deployed in critical infrastructure and lack long-term support from vendors, the botnet poses potential disruptions to telecommunications and online services. Increased DDoS attack capabilities from such large botnets can affect businesses, impede communications, and potentially compromise sensitive data, making it crucial for organizations to bolster their defenses.

3) **What actions should be taken**: Organizations should reinforce their cybersecurity protocols concerning IoT devices by updating them to the latest firmware and securing them with unique, robust credentials. It's advisable to deactivate unnecessary remote access features and regularly monitor for suspicious login attempts. Implementing a blocklist strategy with the malicious IP addresses identified by GreyNoise can help mitigate potential threats. Routine checks on IoT device support status and replacing end-of-life models with newer, more secure alternatives can further enhance security. Collaboration with network security firms to receive real-time threat updates may provide additional protection.
