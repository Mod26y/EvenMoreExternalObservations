The article highlights a new cyber attack campaign exploiting an outdated Avast Anti-Rootkit driver to bypass security measures and gain control of systems. Hackers use this technique, known as bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver (BYOVD), to disable a wide array of security products by accessing the kernel level of the operating system. The attack uses malware with a hardcoded list of 142 security processes to identify and disable active security processes, allowing the malicious software to operate undetected and unhindered.

This campaign is significant because it underscores the vulnerabilities inherent in trusted but outdated security software and the consequences of such vulnerabilities. The ability of malware to disable a diverse range of security solutions poses a substantial risk, as it enables cybercriminals to conduct illicit activities without raising alarms. The recurrence of similar exploitations highlights the continuous risk posed by unpatched drivers and the necessity of adopting proactive defensive strategies.

Organizations should consider various actions to mitigate risks from such exploits. They could employ controls to block components based on signatures or hashes, as suggested by Trellix. Additionally, leveraging Microsoftâ€™s vulnerable driver blocklist policy file, particularly in Windows environments, would bolster defense efforts. Regularly updating software and security solutions, combined with comprehensive audits of all installed drivers, can further minimize exposure to these kinds of vulnerabilities. Implementing a layered security approach that extends beyond signature-based detection can also provide heightened protection.
