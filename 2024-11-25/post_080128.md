1) **What happened:** In June 2017, the global shipping company A.P. Møller – Maersk was severely impacted by a malware attack known as NotPetya. This attack was part of a broader conflict involving Ukraine and Russia and affected numerous organizations by exploiting a software update from a Ukrainian software company. Although unintended, the incident escalated to a global crisis, highlighting the significant risks associated with software supply chain attacks. Subsequent high-profile supply chain incidents, such as those involving SolarWinds and 3CX, illustrate the ongoing threat. 

2) **Why it matters:** This incident emphasizes the vulnerabilities within the software supply chain, affecting critical infrastructure across the globe. The attack on Maersk and similar events underline the need for organizations to evaluate and secure their software supply chain rigorously. The substantial financial impact, $10 billion in damages for NotPetya, showcases how damaging such attacks can be. They reveal the inadequacy of traditional third-party risk management approaches and the importance of elevating security measures beyond relying on vendor assurances and documentation like SBOMs. 

3) **Actions to be taken:** Organizations should adopt a proactive approach by implementing mature software supply chain security solutions that independently verify the integrity and security of all software components. This includes using comprehensive tools that perform detailed assessments, identify vulnerabilities, and provide actionable insights. Engaging in these practices enhances the security posture by ensuring that mission-critical software is free from threats and not solely dependent on vendor claims. Enterprises should also foster a culture of continuous assessment and improvement around software acquisition and deployment.
