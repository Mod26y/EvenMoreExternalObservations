### What Happened:

In June 2024, Microsoft released updates for Windows Server that inadvertently disrupted several key features of Microsoft 365 Defender. Specifically, the updates led to problems with the Network Detection and Response (NDR) service, impairing the network data reporting functionality. This issue primarily affects Windows Server 2022 systems, preventing other features that depend on the NDR service, such as Incident Response and Device Inventory, from functioning correctly. Microsoft acknowledged the issue and is working on a fix, promising further information in an upcoming update.

### Why It Matters:

The disruption of the NDR service due to these updates significantly undermines the effectiveness of Microsoft 365 Defender, a critical tool for enterprise security. When network data reporting is interrupted, it impairs an organizationâ€™s ability to detect, investigate, and respond to breaches. This vulnerability could potentially leave endpoints, email, and applications inadequately defended against cyber threats. In environments where timely incident response is crucial, such an impairment could lead to unaddressed security vulnerabilities and unauthorized access, thereby increasing the risk of data breaches and other security incidents.

### Actions to Be Taken:

County administrators should monitor the service health page in the Microsoft 365 admin center to identify and confirm any impacts on their systems. Temporary measures might include reverting to previous Windows Server updates or employing alternative network monitoring tools until a fix is released by Microsoft. Additionally, situational awareness should be heightened, and contingency plans for incident response should be revisited to ensure rapid response in case of security breaches during this period. Communication with internal teams and external vendors about the potential implications and steps being taken to mitigate risks would be prudent.
