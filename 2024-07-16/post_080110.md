### What happened

The SEXi ransomware group, active since February, rebranded itself as "APT Inc." in June. Despite the new name, the group continues to employ its original tactics, leveraging leaked Babuk and LockBit 3 encryptors to attack VMware ESXi and Windows servers, respectively. The group has been demanding ransoms that range from thousands to millions of dollars. Several victims have shared their ransom notes publicly, highlighting the severity and audacity of the cyber criminals. Importantly, there are currently no known vulnerabilities in the Babuk and LockBit 3 encryptors, making recovery challenging without paying the ransom.

### Why it matters

The rebranding of the SEXi ransomware group to APT Inc. suggests an attempt to either evade detection or redefine their criminal identity, which may confuse or mislead potential victims and cybersecurity professionals. The use of robust encryptors like Babuk and LockBit 3 that lack known weaknesses underscores the escalating sophistication of ransomware attacks. Such incidents highlight the ever-present and evolving threat landscape, emphasizing the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures and awareness. The significant financial demands also pose severe operational and reputational risks to victimized organizations.

### What actions should be taken

Organizations are encouraged to reinforce their cybersecurity measures, starting with updating and patching all systems, especially VMware ESXi and Windows servers. Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) can add an additional layer of security. Regular data backups, tested for restoration capabilities, should be maintained and stored offline to ensure data integrity in case of an attack. Furthermore, conducting comprehensive cybersecurity training and awareness programs can help employees recognize potential phishing attacks and ransomware threats. Engaging with cybersecurity experts for vulnerability assessments and adopting ransomware-specific security solutions can further enhance organizational defenses.
