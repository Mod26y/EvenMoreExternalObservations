1) In 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) found that zero-day vulnerabilities were the most frequently exploited by threat actors. This marked a substantial shift from 2022, when fewer than half of the top exploited vulnerabilities were zero-days. Despite public disclosures, these vulnerabilities were exploited for up to two years. Significant flaws were identified in products from vendors like Citrix and Cisco, involving issues like code injection and privilege escalation. CISA suggests that simply patching CVEs is insufficient and recommends additional tools such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) to mitigate risks.

2) The increased exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities underscores a critical concern in cybersecurity, highlighting potential weaknesses in current software development and vulnerability management practices. These vulnerabilities pose heightened risks because they are unknown to the software vendor and lack available patches. As threat actors continue to exploit these vulnerabilities, organizations face increased risks of cyberattacks, data breaches, and disruptions in crucial infrastructure. Understanding these patterns enables organizations to prioritize which threats to address first and the strategies to employ for better cyber resilience.

3) In response to this information, organizations should enhance their cybersecurity posture by implementing a multi-layered defense approach. While regular patching remains critical, adopting additional measures such as endpoint detection and response (EDR), Web application firewalls, and network protocol analyzers can offer more comprehensive protection. Periodic security assessments and audits should be conducted to identify any signs of compromise. Investing in staff training and awareness about the potential risks posed by zero-day exploits can help in early identification and response. Collaboration with cybersecurity entities like CISA for resources and guidance can also contribute to a more robust defensive strategy.
