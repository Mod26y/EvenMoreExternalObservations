Lacoste has become the first brand to employ Cypheme's AI-powered anti-counterfeiting technology, Vrai AI. This technology can identify fake products with a striking 99.7% accuracy by analyzing microscopic visual details through a smartphone photo. The AI solution examines specific features such as logos without requiring any alteration to the products. Additionally, Cypheme offers the Noise Print Label for certain products, which not only verifies authenticity but helps trace back origins of counterfeits.

This development is significant as it addresses the global counterfeiting challenge, which accounts for 2.5% of world trade and poses various risks. By successfully utilizing AI, Lacoste can protect its brand reputation, secure its revenue, and safeguard customer trust. Importantly, this advancement highlights the potential of AI in reducing counterfeit activities across multiple industries, contributing to safer societal conditions.

In response, organizations, especially in high-risk sectors, should consider integrating AI-powered anti-counterfeiting solutions like Vrai AI into their security protocols. Furthermore, companies should continuously evaluate the effectiveness of their anti-counterfeiting measures and keep abreast of technological advancements. Collaboration between industries and sharing best practices will also be vital in addressing this widespread issue comprehensively.
