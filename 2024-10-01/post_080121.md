### What Happened:

The article highlights the growing struggles faced by Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) in US states due to expanding responsibilities and limited resources. State CISOs are tasked with a wide array of duties, including safeguarding residents' data across various domains such as health and education. Despite increased responsibilities for data privacy and risk management, state CISOs report severe budget and staffing shortfalls. This constrasts sharply with federal cybersecurity funding, where a much larger portion of IT budgets is dedicated. Additionally, physical security concerns have reduced, likely due to shifting infrastructure strategies.

### Why It Matters:

The increased demands on state CISOs, coupled with insufficient funding and personnel, pose significant cybersecurity risks for state governments. These entities hold vast, sensitive data on residents, making them prime targets for cybercriminals. The disparity in cybersecurity resource allocation between state and federal levels exacerbates these vulnerabilities. As state CISOs struggle to maintain adequate cybersecurity measures, the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks grows, potentially jeopardizing the personal information of millions of citizens and undermining public trust.

### What Actions Should Be Taken:

State governments may consider advocating for increased, or at minimum designated, cybersecurity funding to address these gaps. Collaboration with educational institutions and the private sector could help mitigate staffing shortages, evidenced by the example in Texas. Additionally, state CISOs could benefit from more robust integration of cybersecurity considerations into overall state operations, possibly by increasing the involvement of non-security leadership in cybersecurity exercises and decision-making processes. This could help elevate cybersecurity from a perceived cost center to a valued component of state governance, potentially securing better funding and resource allocation.
