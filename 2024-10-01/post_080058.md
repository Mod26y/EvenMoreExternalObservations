**1) What happened:**
Japan's Computer Emergency Response Center (JPCERT/CC) has disseminated methodologies to identify ransomware attacks through Windows Event Logs. By analyzing specific entries across Application, Security, System, and Setup logs, organizations can detect ransomware activity earlier. The guidelines include detecting activity from various ransomware such as Conti, Phobos, and Midas. For example, Conti is identifiable by logs related to the Windows Restart Manager, while Phobos can be traced by logs tied to deleting system backups.

**2) Why it matters:**
The information is crucial because it provides a pragmatic approach for early detection of ransomware, potentially mitigating the broader impact on network systems. Ransomware attacks continue to be a major threat globally, causing substantial financial and operational disruption. By leveraging Windows Event Logs to detect these attacks, system administrators can act swiftly to contain and neutralize the threat before it proliferates, preserving critical data and ensuring business continuity.

**3) What actions should be taken:**
Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity monitoring protocols by incorporating the specific Event IDs and log analysis tips shared by JPCERT/CC into their security information and event management systems. Regular training of IT staff on ransomware detection through Windows Event Logs and continuous updating of detection methods is advisable. Additionally, practicing robust incident response strategies that include immediate action upon detecting suspicious log entries can significantly boost ransomware defense efforts. Conducting periodic reviews and simulated attack scenarios using these guidelines can also help improve preparedness against real threats.
