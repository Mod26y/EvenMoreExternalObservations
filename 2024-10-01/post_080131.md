1) **What happened**  
The US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has called for the update of supply chain security standards for power plants in response to recent supply chain attacks such as those on SolarWinds and MOVEit. Notably, FERC has asked the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) to enhance standards for identifying, assessing, and documenting supply chain risks to electrical grid-related cybersecurity systems. Additionally, FERC proposed a new reliability standard, CIP-015-1, focusing on internal network security monitoring within electronic security perimeters and suggested extending this to other critical systems.

2) **Why it matters**  
The move by FERC to update and tighten supply chain security standards is crucial due to the increasing frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks targeting critical infrastructure. These updates aim to bolster the resilience of the US bulk power system, ensuring the security of the electrical grid which is integral to national security and daily life. By emphasizing supply chain risk assessment and internal network monitoring, FERC intends to address vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries, reducing the risk of outages and enhancing the ability to detect and mitigate intrusions more effectively.

3) **What actions should be taken as a result of this information**  
Entities operating within the energy sector should proactively start identifying and assessing their supply chain cybersecurity risks, validating vendor information, and documenting mitigation efforts. Energy utilities are encouraged to incorporate robust internal network security monitoring (INSM) to detect suspicious activity within their networks. Organizations may consider extending similar scrutiny to physical and electronic access control systems outside their traditional perimeters. Engaging with NERC and staying informed about upcoming regulatory expectations can prepare entities for compliance and help in safeguarding critical infrastructure against evolving cyber threats.
