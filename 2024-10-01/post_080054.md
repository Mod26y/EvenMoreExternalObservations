1. **What Happened**:
Microsoft Defender has introduced a new feature that automatically detects unsecure Wi-Fi networks and alerts users with a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscription. This update includes the ability to automatically enable Defender VPN, which encrypts and routes internet traffic through Microsoft's servers to protect users' data. The feature is available on Android, iOS, and Windows, with macOS support coming soon. It aims to safeguard users from various Wi-Fi-based attacks like Evil Twin and Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM).

2. **Why It Matters**:
The detection and notification of unsecure Wi-Fi networks directly address the growing threat of cyber-attacks on public and untrusted networks. These attacks can lead to sensitive information being stolen, and enabling automatic VPN connections provides an extra layer of security. As public Wi-Fi usage is widespread, this enhancement significantly increases user safety, reducing the risk of data breaches and phishing attacks. This proactive measure by Microsoft helps protect users' privacy without requiring them to be cybersecurity experts.

3. **Actions to be Taken**:
County information security steering committees should consider informing their constituents about the new feature in Microsoft Defender to enhance public Wi-Fi security awareness. Encouraging employees and users to exploit this feature while using public Wi-Fi networks can minimize exposure to cyber threats. Additionally, reinforcing general cybersecurity best practices, such as enabling multi-factor authentication and disabling automatic Wi-Fi connections, will further mitigate risks. Monitoring the feature's broader deployment across different devices and countries will help in adapting and updating security policies effectively.
