1) The article likely discusses the increasing vulnerability of satellites and space infrastructure to cyberattacks, emphasizing that hacking space systems is more attainable than previously thought. As space technology becomes pivotal in various sectors, its exposure to threats grows, illustrated by the potential for unauthorized access or disruption of satellite functions. This vulnerability arises from inadequate cybersecurity measures, possibly due to the assumption that space systems are inherently secure due to their location.

2) The issue is critical because space-based systems support essential services on Earth, including GPS, communication, and military operations. A cyberattack on these systems could have wide-reaching impacts, disrupting civilian infrastructure, impairing defense capabilities, and affecting global communications. As reliance on space technology increases, ensuring cybersecurity becomes paramount to national and international security.

3) To address the vulnerability of space systems to cyber threats, organizations and governments should conduct thorough risk assessments of their satellite operations and enhance security protocols. This involves implementing robust encryption measures, routinely updating software, and adopting intrusion detection systems. Collaboration between government agencies and the private sector to share threat intelligence and develop industry standards can further safeguard these critical infrastructures.
