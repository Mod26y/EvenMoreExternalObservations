**1) What happened:**

Threat actors have intensified scanning for Git configuration files throughout the internet, notably between April 20-21, 2025, as reported by GreyNoise. Nearly 4,800 unique IP addresses engaged in this activity, marking a significant spike from usual activity. These scans target Git config files, which may contain sensitive information such as account credentials, access tokens, and URLs. The global distribution of this malicious activity was most prevalent in Singapore, while the U.S., Germany, Spain, the UK, and India also experienced significant impacts.

**2) Why it matters:**

The spike in scans for Git configuration files is concerning due to the potential exposure of sensitive data and credentials, enabling unauthorized access to cloud services and repositories. Historically, these breaches have led to significant data compromises, as seen in the EmeraldWhale operation and the Internet Archive breach. The recurring nature of these scanning waves could signify persistent or evolving threats targeting critical infrastructure, potentially leading to data theft, service disruptions, and financial losses if organizations do not address them effectively.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should prioritize blocking public access to .git/ directories and configuring web servers to restrict access to hidden files. Regular server log reviews can help detect unauthorized attempts to access Git config files. If unauthorized access is detected, organizations should immediately rotate any credentials contained within these files. Additionally, adopting best practices in credential management and continuous security training for developers could further mitigate the risk of leaking sensitive information and enhance the organization's security posture.
