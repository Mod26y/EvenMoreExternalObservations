DrayTek identified a critical security vulnerability, CVE-2025-10547, in its Vigor router models that allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests to the device's Web User Interface (WebUI). This exploit could lead to memory corruption and system crashes, potentially allowing remote code execution under certain conditions. The vulnerability originates from an uninitialized stack value used in the free() function, enabling attackers to manipulate memory locations.

This vulnerability is significant because Vigor routers are extensively used by prosumers and small to medium businesses, making them likely targets for cyberattacks. If not addressed, attackers could exploit this flaw to compromise network security, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or denial of service. Given the wide usage of affected models, the potential impact on SMB environments could be substantial, slowing their operations and exposing sensitive information.

It is advisable for system administrators to promptly apply the recommended firmware updates provided by DrayTek to secure their systems against this vulnerability. Additionally, reducing WAN exposure by disabling remote WebUI/SSL VPN access or using access control lists (ACLs) or VLANs may further mitigate risk. Monitoring for disclosures from researchers like Maes for further technical details is also prudent to reinforce defenses against such vulnerabilities.
