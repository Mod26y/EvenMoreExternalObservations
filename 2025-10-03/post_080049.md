1) The article discusses a trend where the number of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) is increasing, yet cyber insurance policies are not being adjusted to reflect these heightened risks. This discrepancy suggests that insurers may not be fully accounting for the growing landscape of cyber threats, potentially leaving organizations less protected than they assume through their current insurance coverage.

2) This situation matters because organizations rely on cyber insurance as a safety net against financial losses from cyber incidents. If policies don't adapt to the rising prevalence of vulnerabilities, businesses might face unexpected coverage gaps. This could result in substantial out-of-pocket expenses following attacks, significantly affecting their financial stability and operational continuity.

3) Organizations should conduct thorough reviews of their cybersecurity posture and insurance policies. Engaging with insurance providers to understand coverage terms and potential limitations in light of increasing CVEs is advisable. Businesses can also benefit from enhancing their cybersecurity defenses and practices, ensuring sufficient mitigations are in place should an insurance claim not fully cover a breach incident's costs.
