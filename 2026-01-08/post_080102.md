1) What happened: The article highlights that ChatGPT's market share is declining, dropping from an 86% share a year ago to about 65% in January 2026. This decline coincides with the rise of Google Gemini, which has gained a 21.5% market share. Other AI tools like Grok and Claude are also slowly increasing their presence. Alongside this shift, OpenAI is considering introducing ads on ChatGPT, despite concerns about user retention.

2) Why it matters: The shift in market share indicates that competition in the AI space is intensifying, with users diversifying their tool preferences. For security teams, this diversification may imply new security challenges, as each AI tool could have different vulnerabilities and data handling practices. Additionally, OpenAI’s consideration of ads could change user experiences and trust, influencing enterprise adoption strategies.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should reassess their AI tool usage policies, considering security implications as more tools like Gemini gain traction. This includes evaluating the security practices and data policies of alternative AI providers to ensure compliance and safeguard sensitive information. To prepare for potential changes in AI service models, such as ads, companies could engage in user experience assessments to predict impacts on productivity and security.
