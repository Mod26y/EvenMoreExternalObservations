1) The jsPDF library has a critical vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-68428, which allows attackers to include local files in PDF documents generated by the library. This occurs through local file inclusion and path traversal, where unsanitized paths can be passed to the library's file loading functions. This flaw affects jsPDF versions before 4.0 in Node.js builds, specifically leading functions like 'loadFile', 'addImage', and 'addFont' to inadvertently disclose sensitive file contents.

2) This vulnerability matters because jsPDF is extensively used, with over 3.5 million weekly downloads. Exploiting this flaw could lead to severe data breaches, as attackers might gain access to confidential data on victims' local filesystems. The risk of exploitation increases given the library's broad deployment across various projects globally, making it a significant security concern for organizations relying on jsPDF for generating PDFs.

3) To mitigate this vulnerability, it is advised to update to jsPDF version 4.0.0 or later. This version restricts filesystem access by default and utilizes Node.js permission modes. For environments where upgrading isn't immediately feasible, user input should be strictly sanitized, and trusted configurations or allowlists should be enforced for file paths. It is also crucial to adjust Node.js settings, including the '--permission' flag, with caution to avoid negating the security measures. Regularly reviewing and tightening filesystem permissions would further shield against potential attacks.
