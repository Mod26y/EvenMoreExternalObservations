1) OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Health, a dedicated platform for health-related conversations, which promises not to utilize private health information to train its AI models. ChatGPT Health aims to offer a secure space for health dialogues, prompting users during regular chats to switch to this space for health inquiries. Early access is being gradually provided to users through a waitlist. OpenAI emphasizes the importance of not considering ChatGPT's responses as medical advice, thereby acknowledging its role as a tool rather than a healthcare provider.

2) This development holds significance as it reflects OpenAI's response to privacy concerns, particularly concerning sensitive health data. As AI applications in healthcare grow, ensuring robust privacy safeguards can build user trust and support the ethical use of AI in personal and sensitive areas. Additionally, by clearly not using health data in training models, OpenAI sets a precedent for responsible data handling—a critical aspect in protecting user privacy in the digital age.

3) Counties should monitor developments in AI tools like ChatGPT Health to understand better how they interact with public data and what safeguards are in place. Security protocols around health data should be reviewed in light of new technologies, ensuring compliance with privacy laws and regulations. Stakeholders might also consider creating awareness campaigns to educate the community on responsibly using AI tools, emphasizing that such technology should not replace professional medical advice or treatment. Lastly, assessing county resources for managing and responding to any potential misuse of AI-related health information could be valuable.
