### What Happened

A vulnerability called "Bring Your Own Installer" (BYOI) was exploited to bypass SentinelOne's endpoint detection and response (EDR) tamper protection, facilitating the deployment of Babuk ransomware. Threat actors utilized this technique, which does not depend on third-party tools, by exploiting SentinelOneâ€™s update process. During the upgrade, the agent terminates to update files, providing a brief window for attackers to forcefully halt the process and disable protective services on the device. This attack method was discovered by the Aon's Stroz Friedberg Incident Response team during their investigation of a ransomware attack.

### Why It Matters

This newly discovered EDR bypass is significant because it exploits a built-in feature within the SentinelOne software, an approach that could potentially apply to other software with similar vulnerabilities. This type of attack can leave entire networks unprotected if it can successfully disable endpoint protections, increasing vulnerability to ransomware threats. The fact that this technique was active in real-world attacks underscores the importance of understanding and addressing such vulnerabilities before they result in more extensive damage.

### What Actions Should Be Taken

Organizations using SentinelOne should prioritize enabling the "Online Authorization" feature. This mitigates the risk by requiring console approval for any local upgrades, downgrades, or uninstalls, closing the exploited gap. Additionally, a regular review of security policies and proactive scanning for administrative access vulnerabilities can help identify and close gaps before exploitations occur. For broader preparedness, IT teams should stay informed about shared advisories from EDR vendors regarding similar vulnerabilities that may affect other platforms. Regular cybersecurity training to raise awareness about potential exploitation techniques should be part of organizational strategy.
