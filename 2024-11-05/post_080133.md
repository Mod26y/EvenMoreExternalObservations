1) What happened: The OWASP has enhanced its GenAI security guidance to address the increasing threat of deepfakes and AI-generated content, which now constitutes a significant portion of email communications. Incidents like a job candidate deepfake at Exabeam highlight the sophistication of these attacks. In response, OWASP released new guidance documents, including preparations for deepfake events and establishing AI security centers of excellence. These resources are designed to assist companies in utilizing AI technology safely while maintaining competitive advantages.

2) Why it matters: With AI-generated content and deepfakes increasing, these developments pose serious risks to reputation, security, and operational integrity. The Exabeam incident illustrates how deepfakes can deceive established vetting processes, emphasizing the need for robust defenses. Organizations face the challenge of adapting to sophisticated GenAI attacks, which demand improvements in both technology solutions and security processes. This issue's growing prominence means unprepared organizations could suffer from data breaches, fraud, and other security incidents if they do not adapt.

3) Actions to take: Organizations should evaluate and potentially adopt the OWASP guidance to improve their defenses against AI threats, including establishing AI security centers of excellence and incident-response plans. Security teams might consider integrating technical solutions for detecting deepfakes into their security infrastructure and developing processes to authenticate interactions with human employees. Companies should educate their workforce on the possibility of deepfakes, though reliance solely on human training to identify them may be ineffective. Proactively upgrading SIEM systems and monitoring practices could also be beneficial in staying ahead of potential deepfake advancements.
