### What happened?
ISAGCA (ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance) released a white paper exploring outcomes of zero trust cybersecurity models in the context of operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS). Titled "Zero Trust Outcomes Using ISA/IEC 62443 Standards," the paper discusses how the ISA/IEC 62443 series of standards can support zero trust principles in OT environments. The paper emphasizes not to introduce zero trust for essential functions and highlights the importance of never interrupting critical safety functions within zero trust architectures.

### Why it matters?
This report is significant because it bridges the zero trust model, which assumes inherent risk internally and externally, with the specialized requirements of OT and ICS environments. These environments are foundational to critical infrastructure, making the secure implementation of cybersecurity principles essential to national safety and functioning. By aligning zero trust concepts with the widely accepted ISA/IEC 62443 standards, it provides a structured approach to enhance cybersecurity while ensuring operational safety.

### What actions should be taken?
Security steering committees should consider the findings from the ISAGCA white paper to inform their strategies for adopting zero trust models within OT environments. Committees might evaluate their current security frameworks against the ISA/IEC 62443 standards to identify gaps and areas where zero trust principles could enhance security. They could also prioritize critical functions and safety considerations to ensure that zero trust implementations do not disrupt these essential areas. Periodic reviews and updates to their cybersecurity policies should be conducted to incorporate the latest standards and guidance.
