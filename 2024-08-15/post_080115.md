### What Happened

Mimecast, a key player in Human Risk Management (HRM), has announced the acquisition of Aware, an AI-driven collaboration security platform. This move signifies Mimecast's commitment to bolstering its HRM capabilities through artificial intelligence to better address human-centered security risks. The deal builds on Mimecast's recent innovations and acquisitions in this space, positioning it to improve security across collaborative workspaces like Slack, Teams, and Zoom.

### Why It Matters

This acquisition is significant as it highlights the growing importance of human behavior in cybersecurity. Traditional security measures often overlook the nuanced risks posed by human interactions across modern collaboration tools. Incorporating Aware's AI technology, which can interpret complex human communications, enables more effective threat detection and compliance management. This is crucial for organizations looking to mitigate risks like insider threats, social engineering attacks, and human error, which are becoming increasingly prevalent as digital collaboration expands.

### Actions to Take

Organizations should consider leveraging solutions like Mimecast's enhanced HRM platform, which now includes Awareâ€™s advanced AI capabilities, to identify and mitigate human-centric risks. Evaluating and potentially integrating such technology can provide better visibility and control over unstructured data within collaboration tools, improving overall security posture. Additionally, investing in comprehensive training programs to enhance human risk awareness can further reduce the likelihood of breaches due to human factors. Engaging with vendors that offer robust human risk management solutions can be a strategic move to safeguard sensitive information and maintain compliance.
