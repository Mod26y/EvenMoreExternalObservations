**What Happened:** Marriott International and its subsidiary, Starwood Hotels, have settled with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over a series of data breaches impacting over 344 million customers by agreeing to pay $52 million. The breaches exposed sensitive customer information, including payment card details and unencrypted passport numbers, over several years. These incidents showcased severe lapses in data security and delayed breach recognition, leading to extended customer exposure to risks.

**Why It Matters:** This case highlights the substantial risk and potential financial consequences of inadequate cybersecurity practices. The breaches at Marriott underscore vulnerabilities within large organizations and the severe impact on consumer privacy and trust when data security is compromised. Such settlements stress the importance of maintaining rigorous cybersecurity measures and timely responses to breaches. They serve as a cautionary tale for other organizations, indicating that lax security practices can lead to significant legal and financial repercussions.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:** Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity measures by implementing comprehensive information security programs similar to those ordered for Marriott and Starwood. This includes regular third-party assessments, limiting data retention, enabling data deletion requests, and maintaining transparency in data handling practices. Companies should also ensure robust password controls, keep software updated, monitor IT environments rigorously, and adopt prompt breach detection and response mechanisms to protect consumer data effectively and mitigate potential legal and financial liabilities.
