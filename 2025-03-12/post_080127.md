**What happened:**  
Unfortunately, due to access restrictions resulting in a 403 Client Error, the article's specific content is unavailable. However, from the title, we can infer that the article discusses the concept of democratizing cybersecurity, which involves spreading responsibility and awareness of security practices across an organization. This trend indicates a shift from a centralized model of cybersecurity management to one that empowers more individuals within an organization to contribute to security efforts.

**Why it matters:**  
The idea of democratizing cybersecurity is important because cybersecurity threats are increasingly sophisticated and pervasive, requiring vigilance at all levels of an organization. By distributing cybersecurity responsibilities beyond the IT or information security department, organizations can potentially improve their security posture. This approach fosters a culture of security awareness, enhances the ability to detect and respond to threats quickly, and reduces the risk of breaches caused by negligence or lack of awareness among employees.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations should consider adopting an approach that empowers all employees to participate in maintaining cybersecurity. This can be achieved through regular training and awareness programs, encouraging a culture of cybersecurity mindfulness, and implementing easy-to-use tools that allow employees to report suspicious activities. Additionally, leadership should ensure transparent communication channels and policies that support this democratized model, enabling individuals to take responsibility for security practices suitable to their roles. These efforts can collectively enhance the security posture and resilience of the organization against cyber threats.
