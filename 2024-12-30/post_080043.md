1) The article discusses the increasing threats of deepfakes and "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, anticipated to be significant by 2025. Cybercriminals have been leveraging artificial intelligence to deploy sophisticated attacks, including AI-generated phishing emails and deepfake media, undermining trust and escalating social tensions. Notably, during recent APAC elections, deepfakes were utilized for misinformation and fraud, highlighting the transition of these tactics from political arenas to corporate environments. The article also warns about the potential for quantum computing to enable decrypting presently secure data, posing a long-term threat to data security.

2) This development is crucial as it marks the rising use and sophistication of AI technologies in cyberattacks, challenging traditional security measures. Deepfakes can severely impact public trust, corporate integrity, and political stability by disseminating false information and facilitating fraud. Furthermore, the imminent era of quantum computing threatens current encryption models, posing risks to sensitive data's confidentiality. Organizations need to adapt their security strategies to counter these evolving threats, ensuring that critical communications and data remain protected in a rapidly advancing technological landscape.

3) Organizations should consider adopting advanced AI-driven security measures to detect and mitigate attacks involving deepfakes and other AI-facilitated tactics. Building an infrastructure supporting quantum-resistant cryptography is advisable to prepare for potential threats stemming from quantum computing advancements. A unified security platform could offer centralized risk visibility and effective remediation, improving operational efficiency and response capabilities. Additionally, continuous monitoring and updating of encryption practices should be prioritized to safeguard against future decrypting capabilities afforded by quantum technology. Engaging in regular cybersecurity training and awareness initiatives can further bolster internal defenses against sophisticated cyber threats.
