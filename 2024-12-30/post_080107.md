**What happened:**  
Google announced a significant milestone in quantum computing with its Willow chip, promising reduced noise and errors as qubits increase. This advancement, known as "threshold scalability," is pivotal in moving towards advanced quantum computing. Meanwhile, other tech giants and researchers have reported their own progress in qubit scaling and quantum computing capabilities. The industry is recognizing the potential quantum threat to encryption and urging early preparation for post-quantum technologies.

**Why it matters:**  
Quantum computing poses a potential threat to cryptographic systems currently securing digital communications. If successful, quantum computers could break widely used cryptographic schemes, risking data security across financial systems, industries, and personal privacy. The emerging capability to decrypt data captured today when these quantum systems become mainstream could have dire implications, driving an urgent need for migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to protect sensitive information against future vulnerabilities.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations should focus on transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic solutions to safeguard sensitive data before quantum computers pose a practical threat. This includes adopting PQC technologies, like post-quantum encryption and quantum key distribution, while enhancing current cryptographic measures with quantum-ready solutions such as quantum random number generation. Monitoring advancements in quantum computing should be integral to cybersecurity strategies, ensuring continuous assessment and updating of cryptographic defenses in anticipation of quantum-related risks.
