The Casio UK online store experienced a security breach where hackers modified the website's code to steal customer credit card information by using a skimming attack. Malicious scripts, placed on the website between January 14 and 24, 2025, replaced the legitimate checkout process with a fake form designed to capture sensitive information. The attack utilized Magento vulnerabilities and involved a two-stage skimmer technique linked to a Russian server. Despite having a Content Security Policy (CSP), Casio's improper configuration allowed this breach to happen, highlighting their ongoing struggle with cybersecurity incidents, including previous data breaches and ransomware attacks.

This breach matters because it exposes the vulnerabilities in e-commerce platforms and the need for robust security measures beyond superficial protections like loosely configured CSPs. The incident raises concerns about Casio's ability to safeguard customer data and highlights a broader trend of target attacks on e-commerce sites to harvest financial information. For the customers affected, this means potential financial loss and identity theft risks. For Casio and similar companies, it demonstrates the importance of maintaining stringent security practices and monitoring systems to defend against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.

To address such vulnerabilities and safeguard customer information, Casio and other e-commerce entities should conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the entire scope of the breach. Strengthening website security policies, such as properly configuring CSPs and implementing immediate incident detection and response protocols, will be crucial. Regular security audits, patching known vulnerabilities, and developing comprehensive reporting systems can prevent unauthorized script executions. Moreover, reinforcing customer notification practices and offering identity theft protection services could help manage the aftermath of such breaches and enhance consumer trust.
