Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wordpress-security-plugin-exposes-private-data-to-site-subscribers/

**1) What happened:** A vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-11705 was discovered in the Anti-Malware Security and Brute-Force Firewall plugin for WordPress, affecting versions 4.23.81 and earlier. This issue enables subscribers of a website to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive data such as database credentials. This flaw was due to missing capability checks in the `GOTMLS_ajax_scan()` function. Although considered not critical due to authentication requirements, the vulnerability posed a risk to sites with subscriber-based access. A patch was released with version 4.23.83 to address this by implementing a user capability check.

**2) Why it matters:** This vulnerability exposes a significant risk to websites using the affected WordPress plugin, especially those with subscription or membership features, as it provides a path for data breaches through unauthorized access to sensitive server files. The exposure of configuration files like `wp-config.php` can lead to further compromise by allowing attackers to access database credentials and subsequently extract private data. Since sensitive data could be misused for identity theft or further attacks, addressing the vulnerability is crucial to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of website data.

**3) What actions should be taken:** Administrators of WordPress sites using the affected plugin should upgrade to version 4.23.83 or later immediately to mitigate the risk. It is advisable also to review and manage user account permissions to limit unnecessary access levels and regularly monitor for unauthorized activities on the sites. Additionally, site owners should perform regular backups and consider implementing cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection mitigations for added security. Furthermore, educating users on choosing strong, unique passwords can help bolster defense against potential attacks.
