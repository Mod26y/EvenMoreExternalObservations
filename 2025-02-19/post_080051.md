The incident highlighted involves two vulnerabilities in the Xerox VersaLink C7025 multifunction printers, impacting versions 57.69.91 and earlier, which allow attackers to perform pass-back attacks and capture user credentials. These vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-12510 and CVE-2024-12511, permit unauthorized changes to LDAP and SMB settings. By exploiting these flaws, attackers can redirect credential verification processes to malicious servers, thereby capturing sensitive credentials such as Windows Active Directory, which could later be used for lateral movement within an organization's network.

The significance of these vulnerabilities lies in their potential to grant attackers substantial access to critical Windows environments, including domain admin credentials in some cases. This could enable unauthorized access to sensitive organizational resources like file services, email accounts, and databases. Given the increasing reliance on remote work and the underestimated risk of printer vulnerabilities, this issue represents a serious cybersecurity threat, as demonstrated by 67% of organizations experiencing incidents tied to printer vulnerabilities according to a Quocirca 2024 study.

Organizations should prioritize updating their Xerox VersaLink MFPs with the patched firmware to mitigate these vulnerabilities. If immediate patching isn't feasible, it's advisable to implement complex admin passwords and avoid using highly privileged accounts for LDAP and SMB configurations. Disabling remote-control console access for unauthenticated users can also help reduce risk. Regular security audits of printer devices and enforcing stringent access controls to sensitive configurations are essential strategies to enhance printer security and prevent exploitation.
