Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/zklend-loses-95m-in-crypto-heist-asks-hacker-to-return-90-percent/

**1) What happened:**  
zkLend, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on the Starknet blockchain, experienced a cyber attack in which hackers exploited a bug in their smart contract, resulting in the theft of 3,600 Ethereum worth $9.5 million. The attackers manipulated a rounding error in the contract's mint and withdraw functions. Despite attempts to launder the stolen funds, the hackers were initially blocked. In response, zkLend publicly offered a whitehat bounty, allowing the hackers to return 90% of the Ethereum to avoid further legal consequences.

**2) Why it matters:**  
This incident highlights ongoing vulnerabilities within the DeFi sector, where smart contract bugs can be exploited for significant financial gain. The attack underscores the importance of robust security measures in decentralized systems, where traditional transaction reversals are not possible. Assurance that the underlying blockchain technology remains secure, as confirmed by Starkware, is crucial. These incidents impact trust and investor confidence in blockchain platforms and emphasize the need for rigorous testing and auditing of smart contracts in decentralized protocols.

**3) What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations should prioritize comprehensive vulnerability assessments and employ third-party security audits to identify and address potential flaws in smart contract code. There should also be an implementation of best practices for smart contract development, including thorough testing environments that simulate potential attack vectors. Establishing a robust incident response plan, including clear protocols for communicating with involved parties and stakeholders, is essential. Strengthening industry-wide collaborations and partnerships with security firms can aid in threat intelligence sharing and proactive defense against similar threats.
