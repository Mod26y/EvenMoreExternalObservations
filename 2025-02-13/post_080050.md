Ivanti has released updates to fix three critical vulnerabilities in its Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and Secure Access Client products. These flaws were revealed through its responsible disclosure program involving parties like CISA and Akamai. Although no active exploitation has been reported, the vulnerabilities—which include a stack-based buffer overflow, external file name control, and code injection—have critical severity scores and require authenticated access, with some needing admin privileges. The risk of exploitation remains significant due to insider threats or stolen credentials.

The significance of these vulnerabilities lies in their potential for remote exploitation following authentication, which could be facilitated by insider threats or compromised credentials. With a severity score as high as 9.9, the flaws pose serious risks, potentially allowing attackers unauthorized actions such as executing code and file writing. The vulnerabilities affect widely used security software, highlighting the need for swift remediation to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches that could impact organizational security and user confidentiality.

Organizations using the affected Ivanti products should promptly apply the recommended upgrades—ICS version 22.7R2.6, IPS version 22.7R1.3, and ISAC 22.8R1—to address these critical vulnerabilities. It's crucial for entities still on Pulse Connect Secure 9.x to migrate to supported versions since fixes will not be provided. Regular review of privilege access, comprehensive training on phishing threats, and maintaining up-to-date security patches across all systems are essential for mitigating risks associated with such vulnerabilities.
