1) Microsoft announced that Exchange Server 2016 and 2019 have reached their end of support, which means they will no longer receive security updates, timezone adjustments, or technical support after the last security update in October 2025. Mainstream support had already ended for both versions in October 2020 and January 2024, respectively. Microsoft urges administrators to either upgrade to Exchange Server Subscription Edition (SE) or migrate to Exchange Online to maintain security and support, as these outdated servers could become susceptible to breaches and vulnerabilities.

2) The end of support for Exchange 2016 and 2019 is significant as it presents a cybersecurity risk to organizations still operating these versions. Without future security patches and updates, vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers, potentially leading to data breaches and system compromises. For counties and organizations relying on these outdated systems, uninterrupted access to secure communication channels is vital. Therefore, failure to migrate or upgrade could jeopardize sensitive information and disrupt governmental and administrative operations.

3) Organizations should conduct a risk assessment and plan for transitioning their email infrastructure. Consider migrating to Exchange Online, which offers seamless integration with Microsoft 365, or upgrading to Exchange Server SE to ensure continued security compliance. Administrators should familiarize themselves with Microsoft's documented migration paths and guidelines to facilitate a smooth transition. Additionally, organizations could benefit from evaluating their broader IT environment's readiness for other Microsoft software lifecycle changes, such as the end of support for Windows 10, to align with security best practices.
