1) **What happened**: The article emphasizes the importance for critical infrastructure Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) to pay attention to 'back-office clutter' data. This term refers to under-managed or overlooked data residing in systems that support business operations but aren't directly involved in the core functions of critical infrastructure. Such data is often unsecured, making it a potential target for cyberattacks and data breaches. Failure to manage and protect this data can lead to unauthorized access and potentially severe breaches of sensitive information.

2) **Why it matters**: This issue is critical because while frontline systems in critical infrastructure are often well-protected, overlooked 'back-office' data can offer an easy entry point for cybercriminals. Such vulnerabilities could compromise the entire infrastructure, leading to potentially significant financial losses, operational disruptions, or even threats to public safety. In the context of growing cyber threats, ensuring comprehensive data protection, including back-office data, is essential to maintaining the integrity of critical infrastructure.

3) **Actions to be taken**: Organizations should conduct thorough assessments of their back-office data to identify and manage potential vulnerabilities. Implementing robust data management and security practices, including encryption and regular audits, is crucial. Furthermore, training employees to recognize the importance of data security and adhering to updated policies can mitigate risks. Integrating these actions into a broader cybersecurity infrastructure strategy is vital to safeguarding the entirety of their data environment, reducing the likelihood of breaches and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
