1) What happened: Microsoft announced that Windows 10 home users could pay $30 for Extended Security Updates to delay the switch to Windows 11 by one year. This option became available in December 2023 but was priced in this recent announcement. The Extended Security Updates will ensure systems receive bug fixes and security updates beyond Windows 10's official end-of-support date on October 14, 2025. Specialized versions, such as Long-Term Servicing Branch (LTSB), will continue receiving updates beyond this endpoint.

2) Why it matters: This development is significant as over 62% of Windows systems still run Windows 10, posing a risk if these systems remain unsupported. Without updates, users become vulnerable to newly discovered security threats. The provision of Extended Security Updates reflects Microsoft's recognition of the reluctance or inability of many users to transition to Windows 11. This delay helps mitigate potential security risks and provides consumers and enterprises additional time to plan their migration strategies effectively.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should assess their current Windows 10 systems and evaluate the feasibility of transitioning to Windows 11. For those unable to migrate promptly, budgeting for the ESU program might be necessary to ensure security compliance. IT departments should also conduct thorough hardware compatibility evaluations and consider upgrading or replacing older systems to meet Windows 11 requirements. Additionally, rolling out internal communications and user training on Windows 11 features and changes could facilitate smoother transitions ahead of 2025.
