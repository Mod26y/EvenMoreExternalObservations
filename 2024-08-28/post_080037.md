### 1. What Happened
The Pidgin messaging app discovered that a malicious plugin named ScreenShareOTR infiltrated its official third-party plugin repository. This plugin was promoted as a screen-sharing tool for secure Off-The-Record (OTR) communication but was actually used to install keyloggers, information stealers, and DarkGate malware. This malicious plugin was available for both Windows and Linux users and was listed from July 6, 2024, until it was removed on August 16, 2024, following a user report identifying its harmful nature. The plugin leveraged a valid digital certificate from a legitimate Polish company to appear trustworthy.

### 2. Why It Matters
This incident emphasizes the vulnerabilities inherent in using third-party plugins, even from apparently legitimate sources. Since the plugin could silently install dangerous malware like DarkGate, it posed a severe risk to users' personal and corporate data. The ability of the plugin to operate on both Windows and Linux exacerbates the potential scope of the security breach. Moreover, the event highlights the importance of robust security review mechanisms for plugin repositories, as the lack of such measures allowed malicious software to be listed and distributed for over a month.

### 3. What Actions Should Be Taken
Organizations using Pidgin are advised to immediately review their installed plugins and remove ScreenShareOTR or any suspicious plugins. Conducting a comprehensive system scan with a trusted antivirus tool is also recommended to detect and eliminate any malicious code. Entities maintaining plugin repositories should implement stricter code review policies, such as only accepting plugins with OSI Approved Open Source Licenses for transparency. Additionally, users and administrators should be educated about the risks of third-party plugins to foster a culture of vigilant software management.
