Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/notion-exits-russia-and-will-terminate-accounts-in-september/

### 1) What Happened:

Notion, a widely-used productivity tool, announced it will cease operations in Russia and terminate Russian-user accounts by September 9, 2024. This decision follows U.S. government sanctions prohibiting access to certain software services in Russia. Users impacted by this move have until September 8 to export their data, with detailed instructions provided by Notion. After this date, Russian users will lose all access to their accounts, and workspaces will be deleted.

### 2) Why It Matters:

This development is significant because it underscores the broader impact of geopolitical tensions and sanctions on digital services. With Notion being utilized by over 30 million users globally, the termination could disrupt the workflows of Russian professionals and businesses dependent on its productivity features. The situation highlights the necessity for organizations to consider geopolitical risks in their operational continuity and data management strategies, given that access to crucial tools and platforms can be abruptly restricted.

### 3) What Actions Should Be Taken:

Organizations should reassess their reliance on foreign-based digital services and platforms, especially those subject to geopolitical risks. Developing contingency plans for alternative tools and ensuring data can be exported and maintained independently of specific platforms can mitigate potential disruptions. Additionally, entities with international collaborations should notify impacted parties and consider data redundancy solutions to protect collaborative outputs. Being proactive about compliance with international regulations can stave off future operational hiccups triggered by similar sanction-imposed restrictions.
