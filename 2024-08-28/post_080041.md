**What happened:**

Zimbabwe has launched an extensive cybersecurity training program for government officials, graduating over 100 participants. This initiative is in response to a series of cyberattacks that have plagued the nation, including a significant case involving a $120 million theft from the Zimbabwe Manpower Development Fund and various other hacks targeting social media accounts and major banks. The program covers critical areas such as security trends, governance, standards, and enterprise data security issues, aiming to enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of the nation's governmental agencies.

**Why it matters:**

Zimbabwe's proactive steps to educate its government officials in cybersecurity is crucial for several reasons. The country, experiencing rapid digitalization, has become an attractive target for cybercriminals. This situation underscores the importance of strengthening cyber defenses to protect sensitive information and financial assets, thus maintaining national security and economic stability. Cyber incidents can have far-reaching consequences, including loss of public trust and significant financial damage. Training government officials to recognize and mitigate these risks is a pivotal step in safeguarding the country's growing digital infrastructure.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

Drawing from Zimbabwe's approach, the US County's information security steering committee should consider implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity training program for all government employees. Regular training and awareness campaigns could be established to keep staff updated on the latest threat landscapes and best practices. Additionally, a review of current cybersecurity policies and incident response plans might be beneficial, ensuring they align with emerging threats. Investing in advanced cybersecurity tools and conducting frequent audits and penetration tests can further bolster defenses against potential cyber threats.
