Toys “R” Us Canada experienced a data breach where personal information of customers, including names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers, was leaked on the dark web. The breach was discovered on July 30, 2025, and validated by third-party cybersecurity experts. However, sensitive financial data and passwords were not compromised. The company is working with authorities and cybersecurity experts to address the issue, enhance their security protocols, and notify affected individuals and regulatory bodies.

This incident is significant as it highlights the vulnerabilities that even non-financial data can present, particularly for customer trust and privacy. The exposure of personal information can lead to increased risks of phishing attacks and identity theft. It underpins the importance of securing personal data, as breaches can damage customer relationships and tarnish a company's reputation. Regulatory penalties may also be considered, reinforcing the need for stringent data protection measures.

As a response, affected individuals should be advised to stay vigilant for any phishing attempts and refrain from engaging with suspicious messages. Toys “R” Us Canada should continue to work with cybersecurity experts to further enhance their security systems, ensuring robust measures to prevent future incidents. Additionally, a review of data access and storage policies may further safeguard customer information. Clear communication with customers about protective steps and potential risks can help maintain trust.
