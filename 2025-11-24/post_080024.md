### What happened?

Passwork released version 7 of its platform, integrating both password management and secrets management into a unified solution tailored for enterprise use. This update focuses on enhancing credential organization, access control, and administrative functions for enterprises managing distributed teams, applications, and IT infrastructure. With additions like role-based access control (RBAC), vault architecture improvements, and automated credential workflows, Passwork 7 addresses the complexities involved in managing both human and machine authentication credentials across large organizations and improves security, usability, and workflow efficiency.

### Why it matters?

As organizations increasingly operate in complex environments with diverse authentication needs, effective password and secrets management becomes critical to minimize security risks. The integration of these functions in Passwork 7 provides a cohesive solution that not only simplifies management but also strengthens security by offering encryption, rotation, and centralized auditing capabilities. This matters because it ensures compliance with standards like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR, and mitigates risks tied to distributed and ungoverned credentials, thus protecting organizational data from potential breaches.

### What actions should be taken?

Organizations should evaluate Passwork 7 for its potential to consolidate and enhance credential management. By deploying Passwork in a trial, IT and security teams can assess its fit within their existing infrastructure and security policies. Planning a structured vault architecture before transitioning can facilitate an efficient migration if adoption is pursued. Furthermore, enterprises should capitalize on the temporary discount offering, exploring cost-effective acquisition during the promotional window. These actions will bolster operational transparency, compliance, and overall security posture by integrating modern authentication solutions.
