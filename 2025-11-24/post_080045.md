**1) What happened:**

The article outlines a promotional offer from Costco, where new and lapsed members can purchase a 1-Year Gold Star Membership for $65 and receive a $40 Digital Costco Shop Card. This promotion aims to attract new members or those who haven't renewed their membership in over 18 months. The offer involves incentives for enrolling in an auto-renewal program, with the shop card delivered via email within two weeks. This marketing strategy is not available to current members, and there are conditions and exclusions regarding the use and redemption of the promotion.

**2) Why it matters:**

This promotional tactic is significant as it highlights Costco's strategic efforts to draw in new customers and re-engage past members, potentially increasing sales and customer base during the holiday season. The digital delivery of incentives can also present cybersecurity risks related to data handling, phishing scams, and unauthorized use of the digital shop card. Retailers are increasingly using digital incentives, making it crucial for consumers to remain vigilant about cybersecurity threats like phishing, and businesses must ensure secure processing and delivery of digital goods.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should enhance their focus on cybersecurity best practices to protect customer data, especially when delivering digital incentives. Educating customers about the risks of phishing and emphasizing the importance of safeguarding personal information is crucial. Businesses should also validate and secure their email communication channels to prevent spoofing or unauthorized access. Incorporating secure sign-up procedures and robust data privacy protocols will ensure the digital incentives process is safe, thereby fostering trust and minimizing potential cyber threats associated with digital promotions.
