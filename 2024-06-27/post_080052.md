**1) What happened:**

A critical SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-5276, has been discovered in Fortra's FileCatalyst Workflow. This flaw permits remote, unauthenticated attackers to create rogue admin users and manipulate database data by exploiting the 'jobID' parameter without required input sanitization. Tenable researchers discovered the vulnerability on May 15, 2024, and also released a proof-of-concept exploit. Although no active exploitations have been reported, the public release of the exploit significantly raises the risk of attacks. Affected versions are FileCatalyst Workflow 5.1.6 Build 135 and older.

**2) Why it matters:**

This vulnerability is significant due to the wide usage of FileCatalyst Workflow in large file transfers and collaboration efforts globally. The flaw holds a critical CVSS v3.1 score of 9.8, emphasizing its severity. Attacks leveraging this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized administrative access and data tampering, which could disrupt operations and compromise sensitive information. Given the public availability of the exploit, the window for patching before potential mass exploitation is narrow, making immediate awareness and remediation critical for organizations using this software.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations using FileCatalyst Workflow should promptly identify whether they are running an affected version (5.1.6 Build 135 or older). Upgrading to the patched version, FileCatalyst Workflow 5.1.6 build 139, is strongly advised to mitigate the risk. Additionally, organizations should assess and adjust permissions to ensure that anonymous access is disabled unless absolutely necessary. Implementing network monitoring for unusual behavior or attempted exploitation can help in early detection of potential attacks. Conducting a thorough review of access logs post-upgrade can ensure no unauthorized accesses occurred prior to patching.
