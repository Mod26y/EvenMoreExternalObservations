### What Happened

Netskope published a report indicating that CISOs' risk appetites are evolving in light of shifts in the cyber threat landscape. The study surveyed over 1,000 CISOs globally and found that many now prefer to view their roles as enabling business resilience rather than merely managing cyber risks. The research highlights that a significant number of CISOs feel at odds with their C-suite counterparts due to differing perceptions of risk and innovation.

### Why It Matters

This development is crucial because it showcases a shift in the cybersecurity paradigm where CISOs are increasingly seen as pivotal in driving business innovation. However, the misalignment between CISOs and other C-suite executives can lead to friction and impede strategic initiatives. For counties and other large organizations, this dynamic underscores the need to integrate cybersecurity more seamlessly into broader business goals while maintaining robust risk management practices.

### Actions to Be Taken

Given these insights, the steering committee should consider fostering better communication and alignment between the CISO and the broader executive team. Initiating regular, strategic discussions will help ensure that cybersecurity efforts are in harmony with business objectives. Additionally, enhancing the decision-making process with data analytics can support a more nuanced approach to risk that aligns with both security and business imperatives. Encouraging C-suite education on cybersecurity matters can also bridge the gap in understanding and support more cohesive risk management strategies.
