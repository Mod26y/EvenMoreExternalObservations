**What Happened:**

The article suggests that Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are increasingly embracing risk management as part of their roles. However, there remains a notable gap in alignment between CISOs and other C-suite executives. This misalignment can lead to challenges in implementing cohesive cybersecurity strategies and gaining full executive support for necessary security measures.

**Why It Matters:**

The evolving role of CISOs reflects the growing recognition that cybersecurity is not just a technical issue but a critical business risk. Misalignment within the executive team can hinder an organization’s ability to effectively manage cybersecurity risks, potentially leading to vulnerabilities and incidents. Bridging this gap is crucial for fostering a unified approach to cybersecurity, which helps protect the organization’s assets, data, and reputation.

**Actions to Be Taken:**

Enhancing communication and understanding between CISOs and other C-suite members can facilitate better alignment. Regular interdisciplinary meetings, educational workshops, and collaborative risk assessments may improve mutual understanding of cybersecurity risks and strategic objectives. Encouraging a culture where cybersecurity considerations are integrated into business decisions can also support a more cohesive approach, enabling both the security team and the executives to work towards shared goals.
