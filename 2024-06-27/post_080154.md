### 1) What happened

The LockBit ransomware group publicized a false claim, asserting that they had breached the Federal Reserve and stolen 33 terabytes of sensitive banking information. However, it was later clarified that the actual breach occurred at Evolve Bank & Trust, a smaller financial institution. The stolen data has already been released on the dark web. Evolve revealed that they are investigating the incident, have involved law enforcement, and are providing affected customers with credit monitoring and new account numbers as a precaution.

### 2) Why it matters

This incident underscores how ransomware groups may resort to sensationalism to bolster their relevance, potentially causing undue panic and reputational damage to targeted institutions. Misleading claims about breaching high-profile organizations like the Federal Reserve can trigger widespread fear about the security of national financial systems. Understanding the true scope of breaches is crucial for accurately assessing risks and responding effectively. Additionally, it highlights the evolving tactics of cybercriminals, which can serve as a lesson for other institutions to remain vigilant against similar threats.

### 3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information

County IT and security teams should reinforce monitoring and verification processes concerning claims of breaches and ensure timely communication to clarify any misinformation. Institutions should review and, if necessary, enhance their incident response plans, focusing on transparent communication with stakeholders and timely involvement of law enforcement. Additionally, they may consider offering impacted customers protective measures like credit monitoring to mitigate potential harm. Further, risk management frameworks should be regularly assessed and updated to align with the latest security standards and compliance requirements.
