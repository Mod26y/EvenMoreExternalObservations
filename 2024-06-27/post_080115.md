### 1) What Happened:

Netskope's recent global research revealed a shift in the approach and perception of Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) towards cyber risk. The survey indicated that 92% of CISOs face tension with CEOs and the C-suite due to differing risk appetites, with CISOs increasingly viewing their role as business enablers rather than mere protectors. Over recent years, more CISOs report a higher risk tolerance, driven by better data analytics and first-hand experiences with incidents. Despite this shift, many C-suite executives still do not fully recognize the strategic role CISOs play in facilitating innovation.

### 2) Why It Matters:

This data underlines a critical evolution in the cybersecurity landscape where CISOs are becoming more integral to business strategy and innovation. Misalignment between CISOs and other C-suite members can lead to fragmented security approaches, potentially hampering business efficiency and growth. As cybersecurity threats continue to grow in volume and sophistication, the need for a coherent and aligned C-suite becomes paramount. Understanding the role of CISOs in fostering resilience and innovation is essential for robust organizational security postures and business success.

### 3) What Actions Should Be Taken:

Organizations should prioritize enhancing communication and strategic alignment between CISOs and the rest of the C-suite. This could involve regular cross-departmental engagements to ensure mutual understanding of business risks and security measures. Additionally, educating other C-suite members on how modern security strategies like zero trust can enable business objectives could bridge the perception gap. By fostering a collaborative environment, organizations can better integrate CISOs into the strategic decision-making process, ultimately enabling secure innovation and resilience against cyber threats.
