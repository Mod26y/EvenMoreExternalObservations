1. **What happened:**
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), alongside other governmental organizations, published research highlighting that over half of 172 critical open-source projects are using memory-unsafe programming languages. These languages are prone to memory-related errors such as buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities. The investigation found that 52% of these projects contain memory-unsafe code, with some projects, like Linux and Tor, having more than 90% of their code bases in these insecure languages.

2. **Why it matters:**
The prevalence of memory-unsafe code in critical open-source projects poses significant cybersecurity risks. Memory-related vulnerabilities are often exploited by malicious actors to enact attacks such as remote code execution and data breaches. Given the extensive use and dependency on these open-source projects in various systems, from operating systems to major applications, vulnerabilities can propagate widely, affecting numerous downstream systems and services, thereby escalating the potential impact of attacks.

3. **What actions should be taken:**
Organizations should prioritize transitioning existing critical projects to memory-safe languages like Rust, Java, or Go wherever feasible. Additionally, adopting safer coding practices, bolstering dependency management, and conducting thorough and continuous testing, including static, dynamic, and fuzz testing, are essential steps. Ensuring stringent review processes to catch disabled memory-safety features by error or intention is also crucial. These measures collectively will enhance overall system security and minimize the risk associated with memory-unsafe code dependencies.
