### What Happened

The article details a contest hosted by Dark Reading, inviting readers to submit a cybersecurity-related caption for a cartoon. The cartoon seemingly depicts a scenario where there is ambiguity around responsibility for a cybersecurity action or inaction. The contest offers a $25 Amazon gift card for the best-captioned response. This form of engagement aims to attract cybersecurity professionals to share their insights humorously and creatively, focusing on a broad and relatable issue in the industry.

### Why It Matters

Understanding the broader implications is crucial because the situation depicted in the cartoon symbolizes a frequent issue in cybersecurity: ambiguity around responsibility and accountability. Many cybersecurity incidents involve unclear roles, resulting in delayed actions and greater damage. By highlighting this issue through a cartoon and engaging the community to think about it creatively, the contest emphasizes the importance of clearly defined roles and responsibilities in cybersecurity practices within organizations.

### Actions to Be Taken

Consider incorporating more exercises that engage staff in thinking about roles and responsibilities in cybersecurity. Public contests such as this one could also serve as inspiration for internal team-building activities or awareness campaigns about accountability. Furthermore, the steering committee may wish to examine current protocols to ensure that accountability is clear and that all team members understand their roles to avoid the pitfalls depicted in the cartoon.
