1) Fortinet discovered a zero-day vulnerability in its products, leading to unauthorized Single Sign-On (SSO) logins. A zero-day vulnerability is a security flaw that can be exploited by attackers before the vendor is aware or able to patch it. This particular incident involved malicious actors exploiting the vulnerability to gain access to systems by bypassing SSO protections, which can lead to significant compromises in network security and unauthorized data access.

2) This event is significant as it highlights the persistent threats posed by zero-day vulnerabilities, especially in widely-used security products like those offered by Fortinet. Such vulnerabilities can be particularly damaging as they allow attackers to bypass traditional security mechanisms, leading to potential breaches of sensitive information and network disruptions. Identifying and addressing zero-day exploits swiftly is crucial to maintaining the integrity and security of network systems.

3) As a result of this information, organizations using Fortinet products should prioritize reviewing access logs for suspicious SSO activities and increase monitoring around key access points. They should stay updated with Fortinet's advisories regarding patches or workarounds for the zero-day issue. Implementing multi-layered security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, can further protect against unauthorized access while the vulnerability is addressed. Regularly updating and patching all systems will also help mitigate exposure to such zero-day vulnerabilities in the future.
