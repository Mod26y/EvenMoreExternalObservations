**What happened?**

Zacks Investment Research suffered a significant data breach, reportedly involving the exposure of sensitive data for approximately 12 million accounts. A threat actor claimed responsibility for the breach, purportedly gaining access in June 2024. They leaked user details such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses on a hacker forum, requiring cryptocurrency for access. Additionally, the attacker claimed to have accessed Zacks' Active Directory and stolen source code from their websites. This breach closely follows previous incidents in 2021 and 2023, highlighting recurring vulnerabilities in the company's data security infrastructure.

**Why it matters?**

This breach is significant because it not only exposes the personal data of millions of Zacks users but also reflects broader security issues that compromise sensitive financial information and operational code. Given Zacks' influence in the investment research sector, compromised data can have downstream effects on market stakeholders. Furthermore, repeated breaches signal potential systemic vulnerabilities in Zacks' security posture, eroding customer trust and potentially prompting regulatory scrutiny. The inclusion of unsalted SHA-256 hashed passwords indicates suboptimal security practices, further heightening the risk of credential stuffing attacks and identity theft for affected users.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Zacks should conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and rectify vulnerabilities, especially those involving access controls and data encryption. Implementing a stronger, salted password hashing algorithm is crucial to enhance user security. Users need to be promptly notified and advised to change passwords across platforms. It's vital for Zacks to engage with cybersecurity experts to monitor systems for suspicious activities and to develop stronger incident response plans. This situation also illustrates the need for user education on recognizing phishing attempts and managing personal data privacy effectively. Moreover, regulatory bodies may need to examine this incident for potential legal compliance issues.
