1) What happened: Microsoft announced a new feature for Microsoft Teams, allowing security administrators to block external users from contacting organization members through Teams. This update, expected to start in January 2026, integrates with Microsoft Defender for Office 365, enabling management of blocked contacts via the Defender portal. Administrators need to activate specific settings in the Teams admin center to use this feature, which supports up to 4,000 blocked domains and 200 email addresses.

2) Why it matters: This enhancement is crucial for bolstering organizational security against social engineering attacks, particularly those by cybercrime and ransomware groups. By integrating contact blocking into the broader Microsoft 365 security infrastructure, organizations can have centralized control over external communications, reducing the risk of malicious interactions within Teams. With over 320 million monthly users, improving security protocols protects a sizable user base from potential threats, reinforcing compliance and security integrity across the service.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations using Microsoft Teams with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 should prepare for this update by reviewing their current security policies and external communication needs. Security teams should enable the required settings in the Teams admin center to facilitate control over external interactions. It is also advisable to train personnel on identifying and managing suspicious contacts proactively. Additionally, organizations may consider re-evaluating their broader security strategy to incorporate these new features, ensuring robust defense against potential cyber threats.
