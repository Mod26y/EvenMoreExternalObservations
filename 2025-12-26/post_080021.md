OpenAI is reportedly developing a new feature for ChatGPT known as "Skills," similar to the Claude system's capabilities. Currently, ChatGPT has focused on GPTs for prompt-specific tasks, while Claude's Skills utilize folder-based instructions to teach specific abilities and workflows. Skills in Claude are composable, portable, efficient, and powerful, enabling integration and efficient execution of complex tasks with AI. ChatGPT may incorporate similar features, codenamed "hazelnuts," which could enhance user interaction by allowing customizable commands and skills editing, supposedly planned for a 2026 release.

The development of Skills for ChatGPT signifies an evolution in AI capabilities towards more specialized and adaptable functionalities. This evolution matters as it expands the potential applications for AI, allowing it to handle more complex tasks efficiently and providing a more customized and powerful user experience. Enhanced AI capabilities could benefit various sectors, including cybersecurity, by enabling more advanced threat identification and mitigation strategies. Organizations should prepare to leverage these advanced functions in AI tools for optimized digital infrastructure management and cyber defense.

Organizations, including county-level administrative bodies, should monitor developments regarding OpenAI’s Skills feature. Preparing for these advancements includes training staff to integrate AI's differing capabilities into existing workflows and considering how such AI features may enhance various operational areas, including cybersecurity. Regularly reviewing AI's role in organizational strategy and maintaining adaptable systems will support leveraging these emerging technologies as they become available. Additionally, continuous engagement with technology advancements can help optimize resource management and boost efficiency across services.
