1) The article describes a new feature from Google that allows users to change their @gmail.com email address or create a new alias. Previously, while users could switch between different aliases, changing the primary @gmail.com address was not possible. This feature is currently being tested, with initial support documents available in Hindi, indicating a possible testing phase in India before a global rollout. 

2) This development is significant as it provides users with greater flexibility and control over their email addresses, which are critical identifiers in digital accounts. The change could improve user security by facilitating easier management of email aliases and obfuscating primary addresses from potential phishing or spam attacks. This aligns Gmail's features with its competitors like Outlook and ProtonMail, thereby maintaining its competitiveness in the email service market.

3) Organizations should monitor this new Gmail feature's rollout closely to update their user account management and IT support practices accordingly. They should inform employees about this feature, emphasizing how it can aid in maintaining better security and privacy online. Additionally, cybersecurity policies may need updates to ensure that alias management aligns with organizational data protection strategies, minimizing social engineering and phishing risk.
