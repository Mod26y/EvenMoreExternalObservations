**1) What happened?**

The Internet Archive experienced a secondary cybersecurity breach shortly after recovering from an initial breach and DDoS attacks. Unknown hackers accessed the Archive's Zendesk implementation’s access tokens, enabling them to send a mass email to Archive users. The email indicated that the hackers accessed an API key and a Zendesk token improperly managed by the Archive, allowing access to over 800,000 support tickets since 2018. This incident highlights a significant security oversight regarding the rotation and management of sensitive tokens, which allowed unauthorized access to user data.

**2) Why it matters?**

This breach underscores the importance of regular security practices, such as the rotation of access tokens, to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data exposure. It highlights vulnerabilities in organizational security practices, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, service disruptions, and reputational damage. The Internet Archive’s situation serves as a cautionary tale for organizations handling sensitive information, stressing the need for stringent security measures and proactive incident management to protect user data and maintain trust.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Organizations should prioritize regular audits of their security protocols, focusing on access management and token rotation. Establishing a schedule for rotating API keys and access tokens can reduce the window of opportunity for potential breaches. Enhancing incident response plans to include rapid communication with stakeholders after a breach helps in maintaining transparency and trust. Additionally, increasing employee training on security best practices, especially those managing sensitive information, is crucial for effective breach prevention and response. Investing in tools for automated detection and revocation of compromised tokens can further strengthen security posture.
