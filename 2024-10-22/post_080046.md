**What happened:** ETH Zurich researchers identified severe security vulnerabilities in several widely-used end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) cloud storage platforms, including Sync, pCloud, Icedrive, Seafile, and Tresorit. These issues, affecting over 22 million users, allow malicious actors to inject files, tamper with data, and access user files by exploiting weaknesses such as unauthenticated key material and unauthenticated encryption methods. The vulnerabilities are based on the threat model of a compromised server, which sophisticated hackers or nation-state actors may control.

**Why it matters:** End-to-end encryption is the cornerstone of secure cloud data storage, promising users that their data remains private and safe from unauthorized access. The discovery of these vulnerabilities exposes a significant gap between marketing claims and actual security practices, undermining user trust and potentially putting sensitive information at risk. Service providers need to ensure robust encryption practices to protect against advanced threats that can bypass these defenses, especially given the realistic possibility of attacks by sophisticated adversaries.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations using these services should evaluate the risk to their data and consider alternative solutions with stronger security postures. Cloud service providers must prioritize addressing these vulnerabilities, improving cryptographic protocols, and enhancing their security models to prevent future exploits. Regular security assessments, prompt patching, and transparent communication with users about ongoing risks and remediation efforts are crucial. Additionally, advancing user education on encryption and ensuring best practices can strengthen overall cybersecurity resilience.
