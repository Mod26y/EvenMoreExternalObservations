**What happened:** A critical vulnerability in Apache Struts, identified as CVE-2024-53677, has been disclosed and is already being actively exploited. This flaw, with a severity score of 9.5, allows attackers to execute remote code by uploading malicious files through a broken file upload mechanism in Struts versions 2.0.0 to 2.3.37, 2.5.0 to 2.5.33, and 6.0.0 to 6.3.0.2. The vulnerability involves path traversals, enabling attackers to place web shells in restricted directories, which they can use to perform unauthorized actions on compromised systems.

**Why it matters:** Apache Struts is widely used across several sectors, including government and financial services, making this vulnerability particularly impactful. The active exploitation of the flaw presents significant risks, including data breaches and system compromises, which can lead to severe operational disruptions and data loss. Public proof-of-concept exploits accelerate the potential for widespread attacks. Moreover, an incomplete previous fix suggests potential long-term challenges in securing affected applications, highlighting the need for robust monitoring and response strategies.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations utilizing vulnerable Apache Struts versions should promptly upgrade to Struts 6.4.0 or later and adopt the new Action File Upload mechanism. It is crucial to revisit the coding underlying file uploads to incorporate this newer, more secure method, as the previous mechanism remains susceptible to exploitation. Security teams should monitor their systems for unusual activity, particularly focusing on the IP address already identified in the exploitation attempts. Lastly, organizations should engage with national cybersecurity alerts to remain updated on evolving threats.
