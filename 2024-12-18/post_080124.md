**1) What happened:** Delinea has joined the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). This allows Delinea to assign CVE Identifiers to vulnerabilities found specifically in its software products. Being a CNA, Delinea can now directly establish new CVEs and streamline the vulnerability reporting process. This move indicates Delinea's commitment to enhancing cybersecurity through collaboration by contributing to a community-driven effort focused on managing and mitigating emerging cyber threats efficiently.

**2) Why it matters:** Delinea's participation as a CNA is significant as it boosts its role in global cybersecurity efforts by actively managing vulnerabilities found in its products. This enables more rapid responses to zero-day vulnerabilities, thereby strengthening the overall security posture of organizations using Delinea software. Furthermore, having more CNAs improves the effectiveness of vulnerability management globally by ensuring that vulnerabilities are identified, cataloged, and addressed more efficiently, reducing the impact and potential exploitation of such vulnerabilities.

**3) What actions should be taken:** Organizations utilizing Delinea's identity security platform should stay informed about new CVEs published by the company to ensure timely vulnerability management. Cybersecurity teams should integrate these CVEs into their vulnerability assessment processes to address any potential security threats promptly. Additionally, organizations can benefit from reviewing Delinea's responsible disclosure program and Trust Center to enhance their understanding of Delinea's security practices and the steps they can take to protect their infrastructure and sensitive data. They should also consider participating in the broader CVE Program by contributing knowledge about vulnerabilities or utilizing CVE Records in their cybersecurity strategies.
