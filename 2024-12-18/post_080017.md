**What happened:** A sophisticated cyberespionage group known as 'Bitter' has been discovered targeting defense organizations in Turkey with a new malware called MiyaRAT, alongside a previously known tool, WmRAT. Initially deploying WmRAT, the group switched to MiyaRAT when communication failures occurred. These attacks begin with phishing emails that contain attachments designed to execute malicious PowerShell commands. These commands establish a link to a staging domain for further exploitation. The advanced MiyaRAT features enhanced encryption and control capabilities, suggesting it is reserved for high-value targets to minimize detection.

**Why it matters:** This incident highlights the ongoing threat of state-linked cyberespionage targeting critical defense sectors. The sophisticated deployment of MiyaRAT showcases an evolution in cyber threat tactics, emphasizing the adversaries' ability to continuously develop and introduce new malware. The selective use of MiyaRAT suggests an increase in stealth and specificity, potentially making it harder for cybersecurity teams to detect and counter these threats promptly. Identifying such trends informs defense strategies and helps prioritize threat intelligence and response operations.

**Actions to take:** Organizations should enhance their defense mechanisms by updating and applying Identifiers of Compromise (IoCs) and YARA rules provided by threat intelligence companies such as Proofpoint to detect MiyaRAT attempted intrusions. Reviewing and adjusting email security protocols, particularly concerning file attachments, could help prevent similar attacks. Implementing regular trials to test defenses against advanced malware and refining incident response plans may also be valuable. Furthermore, continuous staff training on cybersecurity awareness can mitigate the risk of phishing attacks and improve the overall security posture.
