**What happened:** NVIDIA acknowledged a performance issue in its new NVIDIA App, which can reduce gaming performance by up to 15% when the Game Filters feature is enabled. Users reported the application negatively affects game performance, leading some to uninstall it. As a temporary solution, NVIDIA recommends disabling Game Filters and restarting the game. This issue is significant because it affects gaming experience and performance, especially on systems where the graphical capacity is crucial.

**Why it matters:** The issue is relevant due to NVIDIA's dominance in the GPU market and the widespread use of its products in both gaming and professional environments. Performance drops like the reported 15% can deter user experience significantly, impacting gameplay stability and overall satisfaction. The performance loss is comparable to switching between standard and higher-tier GPU models, thus influencing competitive gaming and rendering applications that rely on high performance. Timely acknowledgment and temporary fixes are crucial to maintaining user trust and system functionality.

**What actions should be taken:** To address the problem, users should follow NVIDIA's guidance to disable Game Filters and restart their games until a permanent fix is released. For IT departments, recommending users refrain from installing the NVIDIA App or rolling back to previous software configurations may be beneficial. Moreover, continuously monitoring updates from NVIDIA for a permanent solution and applying patches when available will help mitigate these issues. Educating users on checking for official NVIDIA communication regarding updates could also prevent further disruptions.
