In an active campaign identified by Microsoft, a threat actor group, possibly linked to Russian interests, targets Microsoft 365 accounts using device code phishing. The targets include organizations across sectors such as government, IT, defense, and energy in regions including Europe and North America. The group, tracked as 'Storm-2372', exploits the authentication process used by input-constrained devices like IoTs and smart TVs, tricking users into entering attacker-generated device codes on legitimate sign-in pages, granting the attackers access to emails and cloud storage without passwords.

This attack is concerning due to its sophisticated exploitation of the lesser-known device code authentication flow, and it significantly threatens critical infrastructure sectors worldwide. The ability of attackers to access emails and organizational resources without passwords, by gaining access to tokens, heightens the risk of sensitive data breaches. Given the suspected nation-state backing, these attacks could lead to espionage, intellectual property theft, disruption of services, and significant reputational damage for the affected organizations.

Organizations should consider blocking device code flow for authentication where possible and apply Conditional Access policies to restrict access to trusted devices or networks. If device code phishing is suspected, quickly revoking user refresh tokens and requiring re-authentication is advisable. Monitoring Entra ID sign-in logs for unusual authentication activities can help identify and mitigate such threats swiftly. Security awareness training should also emphasize recognizing social engineering tactics, such as those used by Storm-2372, to reduce the likelihood of successful attacks.
