### What Happened
Marquis Software Solutions experienced a ransomware attack on August 14, 2025, that compromised the data of over 74 U.S. banks and credit unions. Hackers breached the network through a vulnerability in the SonicWall firewall, allowing them to steal files containing sensitive personal information such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers, financial account details, and dates of birth. Although Marquis claims there is no current evidence of misuse, the company paid ransom to prevent data leakage and is notifying affected customers, totaling over 400,000 individuals.

### Why It Matters
This breach is significant because it impacts a large number of financial institutions and exposes sensitive personal data, which could lead to identity theft and fraud. The incident highlights vulnerabilities in cybersecurity, particularly concerning firewalls and VPNs, which ransomware groups like Akira exploit. The breach underscores the necessity of robust preventive measures and immediate response strategies in financial institutions to safeguard customer information and maintain trust.

### Actions to be Taken
Financial institutions should prioritize updating and patching firewall devices to prevent similar breaches. Implementing and regularly rotating VPN credentials, enabling multifactor authentication, and enhancing network monitoring through increased logging and geo-filtering are crucial steps. An all-encompassing review of access management policies can prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, organizations should conduct regular penetration testing and employee cybersecurity training to improve incident response capabilities and strengthen overall defense mechanisms against evolving cyber threats.
