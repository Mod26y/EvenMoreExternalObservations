The article discusses a severe vulnerability (CVE-2025–8489) in the King Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress, which attackers exploit to gain administrative privileges during user registration. The vulnerability was made public on October 30, resulting in extensive attack activity, with over 48,400 exploit attempts blocked by Wordfence. Attackers utilize a crafted 'admin-ajax.php' request to manipulate user roles, creating unauthorized admin accounts using IP addresses linked to the exploit attempts, which administration can track through log files.

This flaw is critical because it affects around 10,000 WordPress sites using the plugin, compromising website security by granting admin access to unauthorized users. This could lead to data breaches, defacement, or misuse of website functionalities. With over 48,400 blocked attempts, the rapid exploitation following the public disclosure highlights the urgency for affected website administrators to assess and strengthen their security frameworks.

Website owners using King Addons should update to the patched version 51.1.35, which fixes the flaw. Additionally, they should monitor WordPress logs for unauthorized admin accounts, and suspicious IP addresses and consider preventive measures like implementing firewalls and regular security audits. A similar approach should be applied to the Advanced Custom Fields: Extended plugin by upgrading to version 0.9.2 to mitigate remote code execution risks from CVE-2025-13486.
