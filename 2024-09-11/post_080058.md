Original Article: https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/microsoft-discloses-4-zero-days-in-september-update

1. **What happened**:
Microsoft disclosed four zero-day vulnerabilities among 79 patched flaws in its September update. Attackers are actively exploiting these zero-days. Two zero-days concern security bypasses in Windows, while the other two involve privilege escalation and rollback issues in Windows Installer and Windows Update. Seven additional vulnerabilities were labelled critical due to the risk of remote code execution or privilege escalation, with 19 others deemed likely to be exploited because they are low-complexity attacks requiring no user interaction.

2. **Why it matters**:
The disclosure is significant because vulnerabilities relating to security bypasses and privilege escalations can critically compromise security. For example, bypassing security mechanisms in Microsoft Publisher and Windows Mark of the Web enables attackers to execute malicious code by convincing victims to open crafted files. Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities can provide attackers system-level access, leading to full system control. This underscores the urgency for organizations to prioritize the application of these patches to safeguard against active exploitation, thereby enhancing their security posture.

3. **What actions should be taken**:
Organizations should prioritize the deployment of patches for the four actively exploited zero-days (CVE-2024-38226, CVE-2024-38217, CVE-2024-38014, and CVE-2024-43491). It's crucial to ensure that both the servicing stack and security updates are installed to address vulnerabilities in Windows 10 fully. Additional focus should be placed on patching critical remote code execution and privilege escalation vulnerabilities, particularly those in SharePoint Server and Kernel Streaming Service Driver, given their significant impact and lack of workarounds. Regularly reviewing and applying updates can prevent exploitation and maintain robust security defenses.
