Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomhub-ransomware-abuses-kaspersky-tdsskiller-to-disable-edr-software/

**1) What happened:**

The RansomHub ransomware gang leveraged TDSSKiller, a legitimate tool from Kaspersky designed to detect rootkits and bootkits, to disable endpoint detection and response (EDR) services on target systems. By exploiting TDSSKiller, RansomHub bypassed security defenses and then utilized the LaZagne credential-harvesting tool to extract login details from various databases, facilitating lateral movement across the network. The use of TDSSKiller, which is signed with a valid certificate, allowed RansomHub to evade detection by many security solutions.
 
**2) Why it matters:**

This incident underscores the evolving tactics of ransomware gangs, who are increasingly turning to legitimate tools to circumvent advanced security measures. By abusing trusted software like TDSSKiller, attackers can disable robust EDR systems, leaving networks vulnerable to further exploitation. The use of credential-harvesting tools like LaZagne after disabling EDR can lead to extensive data breaches and lateral attacks within the compromised network. Such sophisticated methods highlight significant challenges in distinguishing between legitimate and malicious activities, especially when legitimate tools are used nefariously.
 
**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations can bolster their defenses by enabling tamper protection features on EDR solutions to prevent unauthorized deactivation. Monitoring for specific flags, such as the '-dcsvc' parameter that disables services, and the execution of tools like TDSSKiller, can help detect potential misuse. Additionally, security teams should regularly update their threat detection parameters to recognize when legitimate tools are being leveraged in malicious ways. Conducting continuous security assessments and ensuring robust access controls can further mitigate the risk of exploitation and lateral movement within the network.
