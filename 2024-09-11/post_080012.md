### What Happened:

Ivanti discovered and fixed a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2024-29847) in its Endpoint Management software (EPM), which could allow unauthenticated attackers to gain access to the core server. This vulnerability stems from a deserialization of untrusted data flaw in the agent portal and has been resolved through hot patches and updates. Additionally, Ivanti patched nearly two dozen other high and critical severity flaws in EPM, Workspace Control, and Cloud Service Appliance. Despite the high severity of these vulnerabilities, there have been no known instances of exploitation at the time of the fixes.

### Why It Matters:

The vulnerability's maximum severity rating indicates potential for significant damage, including unauthorized control over core servers, which can lead to extensive data breaches or loss of control over IT infrastructure. With Ivanti's software widely used across various platforms and industries, such vulnerabilities put numerous organizations at risk. The rise in fixed flaws is a double-edged sword, signaling both the presence of numerous vulnerabilities and the active efforts toward improving security. Proactive measures in detecting and patching these vulnerabilities can prevent potentially disastrous cyberattacks.

### Actions to be Taken:

Organizations using Ivanti EPM should immediately apply the latest hot patches and Service Update 6 (SU6) to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. Additionally, it would be prudent to review Ivanti's advisory notes and reinforce endpoint security protocols accordingly. Conducting an internal risk assessment to identify any potential exposure or signs of compromise, as well as implementing enhanced monitoring and alerting systems, can help maintain vigilance. Regularly updating all network devices and systems, alongside fostering robust incident response plans, will further bolster an organization's defensive posture against emerging threats.
