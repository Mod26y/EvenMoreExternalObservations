1) **What happened:**
India's cybersecurity for its space and critical infrastructure has been highlighted as inadequate, especially given the increasing threats posed by nation-state actors. The chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) emphasized the necessity of fortifying cybersecurity measures to protect India's expanding space assets, including the almost 60 satellites in orbit. The nation experiences twice the global average of cyberattacks per organization due to rapid digitization and insufficient cybersecurity infrastructure. Instances of cyberattacks on satellites globally have underscored the urgency of this vulnerability.

2) **Why it matters:**
The inadequacy of cybersecurity for India's space infrastructure is a critical concern, especially as the nation advances its space capabilities and becomes a significant player in the field. Given the geopolitical tensions and the potential for attacks from adversary nations such as China and Pakistan, weak cybersecurity could jeopardize India's space missions and scientific data. The massive attack surface and the high frequency of attacks underline the necessity for robust cybersecurity measures. Without proper defenses, critical infrastructure, command-and-control networks, and valuable scientific data remain vulnerable to potentially devastating cyber threats.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
To mitigate these risks, India could focus on several key actions. First, increased investment in cybersecurity infrastructure and the development of specialized tools tailored for space systems are essential. Second, expanding cybersecurity training and educational programs could help address the shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals, aligning with initiatives like Atmanirbhar Bharat. Third, implementing rigorous security testing for space technology projects and maintaining international cooperation for threat intelligence sharing is crucial. Finally, developing a cybersecurity framework specific to space systems in collaboration with international standards bodies and organizations like NIST could provide a structured approach to protecting space assets.
