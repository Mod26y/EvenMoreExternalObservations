### 1) What Happened

In May 2024, luxury retailer Neiman Marcus experienced a data breach that exposed over 31 million customer email addresses. The breach was linked to an unauthorized access event involving a third-party cloud database platform, Snowflake. Initially, Neiman Marcus reported to the Maine Attorney General that 64,472 individuals were affected. However, Troy Hunt, founder of Have I Been Pwned, identified 31 million unique email addresses in the compromised data. Sensitive information, including names, contact details, gift card information, partial credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and employee IDs, was reportedly compromised. The breach was part of a broader attack affecting multiple organizations lacking multi-factor authentication.

### 2) Why It Matters

This data breach is significant due to its scale and the type of sensitive information exposed. With over 31 million email addresses, the breach poses a considerable risk for targeted phishing attacks and identity theft. The exposure of partial financial information and Social Security numbers further raises the potential for more severe forms of fraud. Additionally, the incident underscores the vulnerabilities linked to third-party cloud services and the critical need for robust security measures, such as multi-factor authentication. The involvement of high-profile entities such as Ticketmaster and Santander in similar breaches indicates a systematic vulnerability across multiple sectors.

### 3) What Actions Should Be Taken

In response to this information, the County's information security steering committee should consider the following actions:

1. **Review and Enhance Third-Party Security**: Conduct a thorough review of security practices involving third-party vendors, ensuring contracts enforce stringent cybersecurity standards and regular audits.
  
2. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication**: Expedite the implementation of multi-factor authentication across all county systems, especially those involving sensitive data or cloud services, to prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Employee Training and Awareness**: Increase cybersecurity awareness and training programs focusing on recognizing phishing attempts and secure handling of personal information.

4. **Incident Response Readiness**: Strengthen the incident response plan to ensure quick identification, containment, and notification procedures in the event of a breach.

5. **Data Inventory and Minimization**: Conduct a data inventory to assess and limit the storage of sensitive information, applying data minimization principles to reduce exposure risk. 

These steps would enhance the countyâ€™s resilience to similar threats and help protect sensitive information from future breaches.
