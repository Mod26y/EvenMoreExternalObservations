1) **What happened:**
Identity orchestration, a new technology trend, is gaining traction, particularly in business-to-consumer (B2C) sectors like financial services, retail, travel, and hospitality. This technology aims to integrate disparate identity systems to provide users with a seamless online experience while maintaining security. Identity orchestration functions as an abstraction layer between identity services and applications, akin to middleware or simultaneous translators, to simplify communication and interaction between complex systems. This development has significant implications for identity and access management (IAM), offering benefits such as improved user experience, increased security, enhanced IT productivity, and organizational flexibility.

2) **Why it matters:**
Identity orchestration's rise addresses critical challenges of managing multiple identity providers and services across hybrid and multicloud environments. For large enterprises with millions of customers and multiple identity silos, this technology is crucial for creating unified and secure user experiences. It enhances security by weeding out fraudulent users and aids in interventions like risk-based MFA and passwordless authentication. Additionally, it streamlines identity management for IT teams, highlighting its potential for reducing labor-intensive tasks. As organizations scale and navigate mergers or market expansions, identity orchestration facilitates smoother transitions and vendor integrations, ultimately fostering a secure and efficient user experience.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
Given the growing significance of identity orchestration, organizations should evaluate their current identity and access management (IAM) systems and consider piloting or adopting identity orchestration solutions, especially if they operate in complex, multi-identity environments. IT administrators and developers should stay informed about the latest developments in this technology to leverage its benefits fully. Risks and benefits should be reviewed, ensuring that identity orchestration aligns with the organizationâ€™s security and user experience goals. Additionally, ongoing training for IT staff on the integration and implementation of such systems will be crucial to maximize productivity and security. Engaging with vendors and industry partners to understand best practices will also be beneficial in navigating this evolving landscape.
