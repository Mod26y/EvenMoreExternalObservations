### 1) What happened?

Microsoft announced that Windows 11, version 22H2, will reach its end of service (EOS) on October 8, 2024. This applies to various editions, including Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations. After this date, affected systems will no longer receive monthly security updates or protections against the latest security threats. Microsoft has already started force-installing the Windows 11 2023 Update (version 23H2) on systems approaching EOS, leveraging machine learning to identify eligible devices.

### 2) Why it matters?

The end of service for Windows 11 22H2 editions means that devices running these versions will no longer receive critical security updates, leaving them vulnerable to emerging threats. For large organizations and counties, such as a US County government, this poses significant security risks, including potential data breaches and system compromises. Staying updated with the latest versions ensures continued protection against vulnerabilities and helps maintain compliance with regulatory standards.

### 3) What actions should be taken?

In light of this information, it would be prudent for the countyâ€™s IT department to audit all systems to identify which devices are running Windows 11 22H2 editions. A migration plan should be developed to update all identified devices to Windows 11 2023 Update (version 23H2) well before the October 8, 2024, EOS date. Additionally, utilizing tools like the PC Health Check app can help verify system eligibility. Staff should be informed and trained about the update process to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth transition.
