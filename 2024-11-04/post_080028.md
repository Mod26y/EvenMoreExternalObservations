1) **What happened**: A high-severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, CVE-2024-38094, found in Microsoft SharePoint, has been exploited to breach corporate networks. The flaw allows unauthorized access to vulnerable SharePoint servers. Attackers leveraged this vulnerability to plant a web shell, compromise a domain admin Exchange service account, and disable security defenses by installing Huorong Antivirus, which conflicted with existing antivirus solutions. This breach enabled lateral movement and credential harvesting using tools like Mimikatz, while also attempting to destroy third-party backups. The vulnerability was patched by Microsoft in July 2024, yet many systems remain unpatched and vulnerable.

2) **Why it matters**: This incident underscores the critical need for timely patch management in preventing significant security breaches. The compromise of SharePoint servers—which are integral to business operations—can lead to complete domain dominance by attackers. This breach also highlights sophisticated tactic techniques, such as disabling antivirus measures and leveraging administrative privileges, which can silently exploit vulnerabilities, maintain persistence, and disrupt recovery efforts, posing severe risks to organizational data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

3) **What actions should be taken**: Organizations should prioritize the immediate application of the July 2024 security patch for Microsoft SharePoint to mitigate the vulnerability. Conducting a comprehensive review of current systems for signs of compromise and ensuring correct configurations of security tools can help in early detection. It would be prudent to strengthen network monitoring and logging practices to detect unusual activities promptly. Additionally, consider revisiting and improving incident response strategies, and ensure regular and secure backups are in place to support recovery if attacks occur.
