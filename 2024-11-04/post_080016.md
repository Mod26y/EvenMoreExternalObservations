**1) What Happened:**

A new ransomware called Interlock is actively targeting FreeBSD servers, an unusual choice given the rarity of such attacks on this operating system. Launched in late September 2024, it has successfully compromised six organizations, including Wayne County, Michigan. Interlock employs a dual-extortion tactic by encrypting data and threatening to release it publicly if ransoms are unpaid. Although initial tests of the ransomware on FreeBSD systems failed, the operation includes a functioning Windows encryptor. This ransomware capitalizes on FreeBSD's usage in critical infrastructure to potentially cause significant disruption.

**2) Why It Matters:**

The emergence of Interlock is concerning due to its focus on FreeBSD, often used in critical infrastructure, making it an attractive target for cybercriminals. Successful attacks on these systems can disrupt essential services, causing widespread impact and financial loss. The use of a double-extortion tactic increases the pressure on victims to comply with ransom demands, with potential reputational damage from leaked information. This shift towards FreeBSD emphasizes the evolving ransomware threat landscape, highlighting the need for robust security measures across less commonly targeted platforms.

**3) Actions to Take:**

Organizations, especially those using FreeBSD, should urgently review and strengthen their cybersecurity defenses. Regularly updating systems and applying patches can mitigate vulnerabilities. Implementing network segmentation can prevent lateral movement in the event of a breach. Security measures such as multi-factor authentication, robust backup protocols, and incident response plans should be prioritized to ensure quick recovery from attacks. Awareness training for staff on phishing and social engineering techniques can further bolster defenses. Collaboration with cybersecurity firms for threat intelligence and response will enhance preparedness against such emerging ransomware threats.
