I'm unable to access the specific content of the article due to a 403 error; however, I can provide an analysis based on the title and common issues associated with Telnet traffic.

1) What happened: The title suggests that Asian countries are struggling to manage Telnet traffic, which is often targeted by malicious actors due to its use of unencrypted communication protocols. Telnet's vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized access and exploitation of networks and devices, often turning them into bots for larger cyber attacks.

2) Why it matters: Unmanaged Telnet traffic represents a significant security risk, as it can be exploited to execute cyber attacks, compromising sensitive data and critical infrastructure. This can have regional and global implications, affecting the economic stability and security of interconnected systems.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should consider transitioning from Telnet to more secure alternatives like SSH, which employs encryption to protect data. Furthermore, implementing network monitoring to detect and block unauthorized Telnet traffic, alongside regular security audits, can help mitigate potential risks. Education on the risks associated with using outdated protocols can increase awareness and prompt timely upgrades across the sector.
