**What happened:** Amazon announced over 175 million customers now use passkeys for account login, following their quiet rollout a year ago. Passkeys leverage public-private cryptographic keys linked to biometrics or PINs, offering secure, faster, and passwordless access. This modern authentication method reportedly protects against phishing and enhances user convenience. Due to its success, Amazon expanded passkey deployment to services including AWS and Audible. However, the limitation of non-portability remains, though FIDO's new specification aims to make cross-platform passkey transfer possible in the future.

**Why it matters:** The rapid adoption of passkeys highlights a significant shift in authentication methods, emphasizing enhanced security and usability. As phishing attacks and data breaches are major cybersecurity concerns, passkeys offer a robust defense by eliminating traditional passwords. Their non-reliance on transmitted credentials greatly reduces vulnerability. The success of Amazon's passkeys shows industry momentum toward secure, user-friendly authentication solutions. For organizations, this trend signifies the importance of proactive adaptation to evolving security practices to protect user data and maintain trust.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations should evaluate integrating passkey systems within their platforms, considering the security and user benefits they confer. Strengthening authentication protocols by adopting passkeys could reduce risks associated with breaches and phishing. Technology teams should also stay informed about advancements in passkey portability and FIDO specifications to ensure future scalability. Additionally, educating users on the importance and process of adopting new security measures like passkeys will further facilitate seamless transitions and improve overall security posture.
