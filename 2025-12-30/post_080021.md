**What happened:**

Coupang, a major South Korean retailer owned by a U.S.-based tech company, faced a significant data breach impacting 33.7 million customers. The breach, one of the worst in South Korean history, exposed personal information such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, and order details. Authorities traced the breach to a former employee who allegedly retained the data but deleted it without transferring it elsewhere. Compensation worth $1.17 billion is being offered to affected customers through purchase vouchers, signaling Coupang’s attempt to regain customer trust.

**Why it matters:**

This breach underscores the persistent threat of insider risks within organizations and the significant ramifications such incidents can have on customer trust and company finances. The sheer scale of this breach, impacting millions and involving sensitive information, highlights vulnerabilities in data security protocols. The incident serves as a cautionary tale for organizations globally, especially those handling large volumes of customer data, to assess and strengthen their internal controls and data protection strategies, minimizing the risk posed by malicious insiders.

**What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should prioritize the implementation of comprehensive insider threat management and data protection strategies. This includes conducting regular audits, enforcing strict access controls, and implementing real-time threat monitoring systems. Employee training on cybersecurity policies should be enhanced to promote awareness and responsiveness to security threats. Employing advanced data encryption and ensuring swift incident response protocols can further mitigate the risks associated with data breaches. Collaborating with cybersecurity experts to assess and enhance current security measures can significantly improve overall data security.
