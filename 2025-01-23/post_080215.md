The article highlights the push for digital identity systems in the Middle East and Africa, focusing on the adoption of multifactor authentication (MFA) and biometrics. Morocco issued millions of electronic identity cards, while the UAE and Egypt are enhancing digital authentication infrastructures. The use of biometrics, supported by national initiatives, is gaining momentum to counteract cybercrime and identity issues in a region where cyber-risk poses a significant concern. Despite these efforts, only a small portion of companies are investing in identity and access management technologies, prioritizing other security measures instead.

The focus on robust authentication matters as it addresses surging cybercrime and fraud risks in regions lacking formal identity systems for millions. Strong digital identity systems can improve trust in online services and safeguard sensitive data while adapting to increased smartphone usage. With cyber risks being a top priority for businesses in these regions, enhancing identity verification mechanisms can reduce vulnerabilities and foster a secure digital economy, promoting broader access to essential services.

As this trend advances, organizations might consider gradually integrating biometric authentication as part of their wider cybersecurity strategy, especially in environments with mobile workforces. They could pilot single sign-on systems and transition to biometrics, ensuring user buy-in and technical feasibility. Additionally, leveraging AI-driven identification methods could further enhance security, blending traditional and cutting-edge techniques to fit into existing infrastructures seamlessly while preparing for emerging threats and evolving cyber challenges.
