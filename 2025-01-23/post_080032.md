**What Happened:**

A new cyberattack tactic has emerged, exploiting the news surrounding Ross Ulbricht to deceive users into running malicious PowerShell scripts. Threat actors use fake but verified Ulbricht accounts on the social media platform X to lure users into joining a Telegram channel under false pretenses. Within the channel, a fake verification process deceives users into copying and executing a PowerShell command, which downloads and potentially executes Cobalt Strike, a tool often used for subsequent malware delivery, including ransomware. This attack is a variation of the popular "Click-Fix" malware distribution tactic using bogus CAPTCHA systems.

**Why It Matters:**

This method represents an evolution of social engineering attacks, showing the adaptability and creativity of threat actors in using current events to increase the credibility of their scams. The fact that it involves verified accounts and trusted platforms like Telegram exacerbates potential damage. Threats like Cobalt Strike can lead to significant security breaches, facilitating further attacks such as data theft or ransomware. Given the widespread use of social engineering in attacks, understanding such tactics is crucial for individuals and organizations to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**

Organizations should enhance employee training on identifying phishing and social engineering tactics, emphasizing caution with running any unexpected scripts or commands. Security teams ought to monitor unusual activity, particularly related to PowerShell usage, and consider using endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to identify potential threats like Cobalt Strike. Creating policies restricting script execution on devices and ensuring email and social media channels are secured can further mitigate risks. Users should be educated on verifying the legitimacy of requests from social platforms and consulting IT support for suspicious activities.
