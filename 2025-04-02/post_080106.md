1) The article likely details a surge in scanning activity targeting Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect VPN systems. This indicates cyber threat actors may be identifying vulnerabilities or trying to exploit existing ones to gain unauthorized access. The scanning activity could signify preparation for or initiation of attacks targeting these systems, which are widely used in enterprise environments for secure remote access.

2) This situation is significant because a successful breach of VPN systems could enable attackers to infiltrate corporate networks, steal sensitive data, disrupt operations, and potentially launch broader attacks from within. Since VPNs are critical for secure remote work, vulnerabilities in them could compromise overall organizational security, especially given the increased remote work arrangements.

3) As a proactive measure, it is advisable to conduct an immediate review of configurations and access controls related to GlobalProtect VPN systems. Ensure that all related software and systems are updated with the latest security patches. Implement continuous monitoring for unusual login attempts or traffic patterns that could indicate scanning or intrusion attempts. Educating staff on recognizing phishing attempts that might leverage VPN credentials is also beneficial.
