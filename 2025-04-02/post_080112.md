I'm unable to access the content of the specified article directly. However, I can provide an analysis based on the title and general knowledge about the topic.

1) What happened:
The title indicates that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is downsizing. This likely refers to budget cuts, workforce reductions, or policy changes that are reducing CISA's capacity to provide the level of support and protection they have offered in the past. Such downsizing may impact CISA’s ability to assist enterprises and government entities in securing critical infrastructure and responding to cyber threats.

2) Why it matters:
CISA plays a critical role in national cybersecurity by offering guidance, threat intelligence, and resources to protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats. Downsizing could lead to decreased support for organizations that rely on CISA’s expertise and services to strengthen their cybersecurity posture. This situation could leave enterprises more vulnerable to cyber attacks, as they might have to seek alternative sources for guidance and threat intelligence, potentially straining their resources.

3) What actions should be taken:
Enterprises should proactively assess their current cybersecurity capabilities and explore partnerships with private cybersecurity firms to fill in the gaps left by CISA's downsizing. They can also participate in industry collaborations and information sharing initiatives, such as ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers), to stay informed about the latest threats and security practices. Additionally, investing in employee cybersecurity training and up-to-date security technologies can help bolster defenses against potential cyber threats.
