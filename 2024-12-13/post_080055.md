### What Happened

In an attack dubbed "Open Sesame," researchers from Claroty Team82 exposed ten vulnerabilities within Ruijie Networks' IoT devices, commonly used for public Wi-Fi. These flaws, found in the Ruijie Reyee cloud management platform, could have allowed attackers to remotely control devices through the cloud-based portal. Three of the vulnerabilities, including a weak password recovery issue and server-side request forgery, had critical CVSS scores of 9 or higher. The attackers could impersonate the cloud platform, facilitating remote code execution by sending malicious commands to other connected devices. Ruijie Networks has since patched these vulnerabilities.

### Why It Matters

This incident underscores the critical vulnerabilities inherent in IoT devices, particularly when managed via insecure cloud platforms. Such weaknesses can allow adversaries to compromise not only the devices themselves but also the internal networks they connect to, posing a severe risk for users in public settings worldwide. The attack's findings emphasize the broader cybersecurity risks associated with poorly secured IoT networks, especially as more devices become interconnected. Effective exploitation could lead to widespread disruptions or unauthorized data access, raising the stakes for vendors to ensure robust security defences.

### What Actions Should Be Taken

Organizations utilizing Ruijie Networks devices should promptly implement the provided patches to protect against these vulnerabilities. Regular audits of cloud management platforms and IoT device configurations are advisable to detect potential security gaps. Adopting strong authentication mechanisms and enhancing monitoring for unusual device behaviors could further reduce risk. Vendors and users should foster a security-first mindset, ensuring resilience against future threats. Also, awareness training sessions regarding IoT security can help stakeholders understand and mitigate risks. Engaging with threat intelligence services can aid in staying ahead of emerging security vulnerabilities.
