### What Happened?

The Quad7 botnet, which had previously targeted TP-Link routers, is now expanding its reach by deploying custom malware to a broader range of devices, including Zyxel VPN appliances, Ruckus wireless routers, and Axentra media servers. The botnet uses various Telnet welcome banners to identify different clusters of infected devices, such as 'alogin' for ASUS routers and 'rlogin' for Ruckus devices. New staging servers, clusters, backdoors, and protocols have been introduced, enhancing the botnet's stealth and operational effectiveness.

### Why It Matters

The evolution and expansion of the Quad7 botnet underscore a significant threat to Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) and VPN routers, as well as media servers. The utilization of new technologies and the abandonment of older, more detectable methods signify that the botnet’s operators are becoming increasingly sophisticated. This poses a greater risk for distributed brute-force attacks on various services like VPNs, Telnet, SSH, and Microsoft 365 accounts, potentially compromising sensitive data and operations. The botnet’s ability to hide its activities more effectively makes it a higher priority for security measures.

### Recommended Actions

Organizations should take proactive measures to mitigate the risks posed by the Quad7 botnet. Updating firmware to the latest versions can close vulnerabilities that the botnet could exploit. Changing default admin credentials to strong, unique passwords can also deter unauthorized access. Disabling unnecessary web admin portals reduces potential attack surfaces. For devices that no longer receive security updates, consider upgrading to newer models that are actively maintained. Monitoring network traffic for unusual patterns may help in detecting and responding to infections early. Regular security audits and employing intrusion detection systems can further enhance resilience against such evolving threats.
