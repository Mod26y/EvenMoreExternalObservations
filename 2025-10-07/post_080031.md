Microsoft is tackling a bug affecting Microsoft 365 users that emerges when Copilot features malfunction as multiple Office applications like Excel, Word, and PowerPoint are run simultaneously. The issue arises due to conflicts between WebView2 instances initiated by these applications. Users have reported challenges with Copilot, Share, and Room Finder, all reliant on WebView2. A resolution is in progress, and Microsoft is committed to communicating developments as they arise.

This matter holds significance as it impacts the functionality of Microsoft's AI-driven productivity tools within Office Suite, crucial for millions of users relying on these applications for daily tasks. The disruption can affect productivity and workflow efficiency. Additionally, similar bugs reported within classic Outlook demonstrate potential systemic issues in Microsoft's software, which could erode trust and usability if not addressed.

Until a fix is available, users could consider staggering the launch of Office applications to mitigate the conflict or closing the initial Office app before starting another that uses Copilot. Organizations should follow updates from Microsoft for patches or workarounds. It might also be useful to utilize incident monitoring to quickly identify such issues and have contingency plans to maintain productivity amidst software inefficiencies.
