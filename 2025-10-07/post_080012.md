**What happened?**

The cybersecurity incident involving Red Hat emerged when the Crimson Collective hacking group claimed to have stolen approximately 570GB of sensitive data. This data reportedly contains around 800 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs), including information about major clients like HSBC and the Department of Defense. Following Red Hat's non-response to extortion demands, another threat group, ShinyHunters, allegedly used their extortion-as-a-service platform to escalate the breach by posting stolen data samples and threatening full disclosure by October 10, 2023, unless a ransom is paid.

**Why it matters?**

This data breach is significant as it highlights the growing trend of using extortion as a service model in cybercrime, where specialized groups orchestrate data theft and extortion. The breach threatens not only Red Hat's reputation but also risks compromising sensitive information about critical organizational infrastructure across various sectors, including those of high-profile clients. Such incidents exacerbate business vulnerabilities, emphasize the cybersecurity risks in software supply chains, and could lead to regulatory consequences for companies that do not adequately protect client data.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity postures by adopting comprehensive data protection strategies, including advanced monitoring and threat detection systems. This involves regular audits of third-party tools and services, like GitLab, to ensure proper access controls and secure repositories. Developing an incident response plan, training employees on cyber hygiene, and engaging in industry collaborations for shared threat intelligence will also be critical. Furthermore, companies under threat may benefit from legal consultations to navigate extortion attempts effectively and ensure compliance with applicable data protection regulations.
