### Summary

The article discusses a recent cyberattack on CDK Global, a significant provider of cloud software and services for the automotive retail industry, which disrupted operations for around 15,000 automotive dealers across the United States. Many dealers reverted to using paper forms and manual processes. Key affected companies, such as Penske, Group I Automotive, and Lithia Motors, reported to the SEC that they were informed by CDK that it could take several days to restore systems. The actual nature of the attack has not been disclosed by CDK, but it is widely believed to be a ransomware attack by the East European group BlackSuit.

The incident underscores the critical importance of robust contingency planning for organizations that rely heavily on SaaS providers. Experts like Cliff Steinhauer of the National Cybersecurity Alliance and Mark Ostrowski from Check Point Software emphasize the need for organizations to extend cybersecurity protections to their vendor and partner networks, implement formal risk management frameworks, and stay informed during the aftermath of such an attack.

The article also highlights that CDK experienced a second attack during its recovery phase, emphasizing the need for meticulous and cautious restoration processes. This event accentuates the broader issue of increasing vulnerability in software supply chains, with a study by Data Theorem indicating that 91% of organizations have had security incidents related to their software suppliers in the past year.
