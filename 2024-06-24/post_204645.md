### Analysis of the Article on Building Application Security Into Shadow IT

#### 1) What happened:
A team of two individuals successfully resolved 70,000 out of 80,000 security vulnerabilities in low-code/no-code (LCNC) applications within three months. This achievement occurred within a framework of citizen development, where non-professional developers create and manage applications using platforms like Microsoft Power Platform. Despite the high volume, significantly vulnerable applications were remediated without causing business disruption.

#### 2) Why it matters:
The dramatic rise in citizen development means that a large number of applications are created by users who are not typically trained in security. This poses a substantial risk to organizations as these applications can be vulnerable to numerous security flaws. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to preventing potential security breaches that could lead to sensitive data exposure, financial loss, and reputational damage. The article underscores the necessity for robust, automated, and self-service application security programs tailored to the unique landscape of shadow IT activities.

#### 3) What actions should be taken:
- **Inventory Management:** Develop a comprehensive inventory of all citizen-developed applications and identify their owners.
- **Policy Clarification:** Define your organizationâ€™s risk appetite and establish clear guidelines for permissible applications.
- **Automated Security Assessments:** Implement automated tools to continuously test and retest citizen-developed applications for vulnerabilities.
- **Self-service Portals:** Create user-friendly documentation and a self-service portal to guide citizen developers on security practices, issue resolutions, and exemption requests.
- **Enforce SLAs:** Establish and enforce service-level agreements for vulnerability remediation.
- **Tracking and Reporting:** Develop mechanisms to track progress and regularly report to executives, securing ongoing management support.
- **Management Buy-In:** Foster an organizational culture that views secure citizen development as an enabler of business growth rather than an impediment.

By implementing these measures, the County can significantly mitigate security risks associated with shadow IT while supporting its digital transformation initiatives.
