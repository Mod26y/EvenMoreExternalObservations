### Summary

**Overview:** The article reports on a breach of the Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT) managed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The breach occurred in January 2024 when hackers deployed a webshell on an Ivanti device, potentially exposing sensitive security assessments and plans from chemical facilities.

**CSAT Functionality:** CSAT is an essential tool used by facilities to report possession of chemicals that could potentially be used for terrorism. High-risk facilities are required to upload sensitive documents like Security Vulnerability Assessments (SVA) and Site Security Plans (SSP) via the CSAT portal.

**Initial Reports and Confirmation:** CISA initially suffered the breach in January, which was first reported by The Record in March. CISA has since confirmed the breach, which allowed a threat actor to upload and utilize a web shell on January 23, 2024.

**Vulnerabilities:** The breach exploited vulnerabilities in the Ivanti Connect Secure appliance. These vulnerabilities include CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887, and CVE-2024-21893. Notably, CVE-2024-21888 was disclosed just one day before the breach.

**Response and Notifications:** Post-breach, CISA took the compromised device offline to investigate potential actions and data exposed. Although there is no direct evidence of data theft and all CSAT data is encrypted with AES 256 encryption, CISA is notifying affected
