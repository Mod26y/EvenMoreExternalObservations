The article discusses a new feature that Google is testing for Chrome on Android called "Digital Credential API." This feature allows websites to securely request identity information such as driver's licenses and passports stored in mobile wallets. Leveraging Android's IdentityCredential system, this API aims to streamline the process of identity verification for online services without requiring users to manually upload documents.

### Key Points

1. **Implementation and Integration**:
    - The Digital Credential API integrates with Android's IdentityCredential system to support various types of credentials.
    - Websites can securely request identity information from digital wallets, enhancing online verification processes.

2. **User Control and Privacy**:
    - Users have the power to approve or deny website requests for identity information.
    - Only necessary information is shared, protecting user data and maintaining control over what is disclosed.

3. **Real-World Applications**:
    - The feature is particularly useful for government and financial services that require verified identity documents digitally.
    - It supports multiple credential formats, including ISO mDoc and W3C verifiable credentials, allowing compatibility with different wallet apps.

4. **Security and Flexibility**:
    - The API's design aims to mitigate the risk of large-scale identity abuse.
    - Google notes that this system is more secure than current methods like custom URL handlers and QR code scanning.

5. **Status and Future Plans**:
    - The feature is still in the experimental phase, with Google refining its development. More detailed information will be shared in the future
