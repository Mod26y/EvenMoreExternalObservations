1. **What happened?**

Google is testing a new feature called "Digital Credential API" for Chrome on Android, which allows websites to securely request identity information like driverâ€™s licenses and passports stored in mobile wallets. This feature leverages Android's IdentityCredential system and would enable users to approve such requests, ensuring that only the necessary information is shared securely.

2. **Why it matters?**

This development is significant as it enhances online identity verification, making it more secure and user-friendly. With increasing online transactions and governmental services shifting digital, securely managing and verifying real-world identity documents using mobile devices aligns with evolving regulatory requirements and consumer expectations for security and privacy. This could also help mitigate identity theft and fraud risks.

3. **What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Information security teams should stay informed about the progress and potential release of the Digital Credential API feature. They should review and update their security policies to incorporate best practices for handling digital identity credentials. Additionally, they might consider collaborating with vendors to explore integrating similar secure identity verification methods and proactively educate users about the benefits and safe usage of such new technology.
