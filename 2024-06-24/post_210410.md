**1. What happened?**

A small team within an organization tackled a significant challenge posed by shadow ITâ€”unauthorized or unmanaged applications created by citizen developers using low-code/no-code platforms. Remarkably, they identified 80,000 security vulnerabilities, managed to fix 70,000 within 90 days, and did so without disrupting business operations. The success was attributed to a well-designed AppSec program tailored for the unique challenges of citizen development, heavily relying on automation and self-service tools.

**2. Why it matters?**

This situation underscores the reality that citizen development is prevalent and here to stay, making it crucial for organizations to address the security challenges it presents. Citizen developers, while accelerating business processes, often lack the technical know-how to avoid creating security vulnerabilities. Ignoring this could expose the organization to significant risk. By highlighting an effective approach to managing these risks, the report sets a precedent for how organizations can leverage automation and structured processes to secure their environment without hindering business innovation.

**3. What actions should be taken?**

Organizations should start by thoroughly inventorying their applications and identifying app owners. Clearly defined policies on risk appetite should guide which applications are acceptable. Regular and automated security assessments should be integrated, ensuring vulnerabilities are promptly identified and addressed. Creating a self-service portal for citizen developers can empower them to rectify issues independently. Establishing and enforcing SLAs ensures timely mitigation of vulnerabilities. Finally, maintaining executive support by tracking and reporting on progress is imperative. These measures will help secure citizen-developed applications while fostering a culture of responsible innovation.
