### Summary

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued a warning about a breach in its Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT) environment. This breach occurred in January 2024 when hackers deployed a web shell on CISA's Ivanti device, potentially exposing sensitive security assessments and plans. The CSAT tool is used by facilities to report their chemical holdings and assess if they are high-risk, prompting them to upload detailed security vulnerability assessments and site security plans if deemed high-risk.

The breach was first reported in March by "The Record" and implicated both the Infrastructure Protection (IP) Gateway and CSAT systems. CISA confirmed the breach on January 23, 2024, and subsequently took the affected device offline for investigation. Specific vulnerabilities exploited during this breach include CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887, and CVE-2024-21893, with some disclosed shortly before the breach itself.

Although CISA asserts that all CSAT data remains encrypted with AES 256 and there's no direct evidence of data theft, they are notifying impacted participants as a precaution. The potential data exposed includes Top-Screen surveys, Security Vulnerability Assessments, Site Security Plans, and CSAT user accounts containing sensitive personal data. CISA advises all CSAT account holders to reset their passwords if reused across other accounts as a security measure.
