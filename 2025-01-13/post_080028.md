The article highlights the IRS's relaunch of the Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN) program, aimed at protecting taxpayers from identity theft and fraudulent tax returns. An IP PIN is a six-digit code that adds a layer of security when filing tax returns, ensuring only legitimate returns are processed under the taxpayer's name. The program was temporarily shut down for maintenance but is now active. With increasing incidents of identity theft and SSN exposure due to data breaches, the program offers a vital safeguard against financial fraud.

The relaunch of the IRS's IP PIN program is significant because it addresses the growing threat of tax-related identity theft. With the exposure of over 100 million Social Security Numbers, the risk of fraudulent tax filings is higher than ever. The IP PIN serves as a robust security measure, helping taxpayers prevent unauthorized filings under their Social Security Numbers. The ability to avoid the consequences of such theft, including financial loss and strenuous recovery processes, makes the program an essential tool for safeguarding personal and financial well-being.

In response to this information, taxpayers should consider enrolling in the IRS's IP PIN program. Doing so enhances security against identity theft, especially in light of recent data breaches. Taxpayers can enroll online or through alternative methods like Form 15227 for income-qualified individuals. Continuous enrollment is recommended for ongoing protection. Taxpayers should also follow best practices, such as keeping the IP PIN private and enrolling early in the year to preempt fraudulent activity. By acting proactively, taxpayers can mitigate the risks of tax-related identity crimes.
