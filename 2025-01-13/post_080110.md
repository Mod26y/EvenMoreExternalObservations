This article describes how various governments in Central Asia and Latin America have adopted Russia's SORM (System for Operative Investigative Activities) wiretapping technology. This technology allows for extensive surveillance by enabling the interception of communications data, including mobile registration, geolocation, and more. As Russian firms supply and support this technology, it potentially grants Russian intelligence access to communications in these regions, raising significant privacy and civil rights concerns. It exemplifies the geopolitical dynamics of surveillance, where technology becomes a tool for extending influence and observing diverse populations without their knowledge.

The deployment of SORM by multiple countries underscores the global proliferation of state surveillance technology. For nations with insufficient privacy laws and oversight, the potential for abuse of such technology is significant, putting vulnerable communities, activists, and foreign travelers at risk. The use of commercially available technologies, like SORM, highlights the wider issue of effective control and legislation of surveillance tools, as they pose threats to civil liberties even outside authoritarian regimes. This proliferation is both a technical threat to information security and a broader societal issue concerning personal freedom and privacy.

Organizations with interests or operations in countries using SORM technologies should enhance their communication security strategies by adopting strong encryption and privacy tools. Informing employees about potential surveillance risks can empower informed decision-making, particularly regarding data protection and transfer. Emphasizing the significance of recognizing and managing surveillance threats, even in seemingly transparent environments, can cultivate a proactive security culture. Moreover, staying updated on the penetration of surveillance technologies globally can guide decisive security policy formation and contribute to robust protection measures, safeguarding both corporate and personal data from systemic threats.
