Ivanti has disclosed a critical remote code execution vulnerability in its Connect Secure appliances, identified as CVE-2025-0282, which has been exploited in zero-day attacks to deploy malware. The flaw involves a stack-based buffer overflow and primarily affects versions of Ivanti Connect Secure, although other products like Ivanti Policy Secure and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA Gateways are also susceptible but not yet targeted. Ivanti has issued patches for Connect Secure but anticipates updates for the other products by January 2025. The vulnerability's severity and the fact that it was exploited before discovery underscore the ongoing challenges of swiftly identifying and mitigating zero-day vulnerabilities.

This vulnerability is significant due to its critical CVSS score of 9.0, indicating a high potential for damage, especially as attackers can exploit it without needing to authenticate, thereby increasing the threat vector. The exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities emphasizes the urgency for organizations to maintain updated cybersecurity protocols and fortify their defenses promptly. Because the flaw affects widely used remote access solutions, it poses a substantial risk to organizations relying on these services to facilitate secure remote operations.

In response to this information, organizations using Ivanti Connect Secure should conduct immediate internal and external ICT scans to detect any indicators of compromise. A factory reset followed by an upgrade to version 22.7R2.5 is advised, regardless of scan outcomes, to ensure the appliance's integrity. Additionally, businesses should configure their Ivanti Policy Secure appliances to avoid internet exposure and prepare for upcoming patches. Collaborating with security partners like Mandiant can aid in understanding the threat landscape and developing stronger security measures in the wake of such vulnerabilities.
