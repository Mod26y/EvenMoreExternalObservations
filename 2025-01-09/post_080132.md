Trend Micro and Intel have formed a collaboration to enhance the detection of covert cybersecurity threats such as fileless malware and advanced ransomware. With Intel's advanced memory scanning (AMS) technology offloaded from CPU to GPU, and integrated hardware-enabled threat detection, this alliance aims to proactively safeguard enterprise systems against sophisticated threats that traditional software-based security may overlook. The integration allows for more effective identification of malicious encryption behaviors, reducing the risk of data breaches and ransomware attacks by leveraging AI-power to detect threats before they can cause significant damage.

This partnership is significant because it tackles sophisticated cybersecurity threats that are increasingly targeting endpoints, representing 40% of attacks in 2023. Fileless malware poses a high risk as it can stealthily execute in-memory or misuse legitimate tools, evading standard security measures and causing severe financial and reputational damage. Trend and Intel's combined solution provides enhanced protection by integrating hardware and AI-powered security layers, empowering organizations to stay ahead of evolving threats, thus providing critical insights and detection capabilities where traditional methods may fail.

In light of this development, organizations should evaluate integrating such advanced endpoint security solutions to bolster their defense against fileless and ransomware threats. Leveraging AI and hardware-augmented security can enhance threat detection while maintaining system performance. Businesses should also increase focus on endpoint protection, ensuring their cybersecurity strategies encompass comprehensive visibility across networks, cloud workloads, and devices. Continuous training and awareness should be provided to staff to recognize and respond to potential threats effectively, enabling a proactive stance in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.
