The Zivver report reveals a growing disconnect between email security practices and regulatory requirements, such as NIS2, DORA, and GDPR. The study highlights overlooked email security risks amid intensifying cyber threats and increasing compliance demands. With email being crucial for business communication, inadequate email security leaves organizations vulnerable to inbound and outbound risks. The findings show that a lack of vendor innovation, significant employee workarounds, and misaligned security spending contribute to these vulnerabilities, as email mistakes are frequent and underreported, bypassing existing security policies.

This matters because email is a fundamental communication tool in organizations, making it a prime target for cyber threats. As regulatory demands become more stringent, failure to address these security gaps could result in data breaches, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage. Many employees do not adhere to security policies, creating an insecure environment and potential data leaks, emphasizing the urgent need to align email security strategies with evolving risk landscapes.

Organizations should enhance their email security measures by integrating comprehensive solutions that tackle both phishing and outbound risks. Prioritizing employee training and awareness can reduce the incidence of workarounds and email-related mistakes. IT spending should be realigned to reflect actual risk levels. Encouraging formal reporting of incidents allows for a better understanding of vulnerabilities. Embedding security measures within workflows can streamline compliance and ensure effective defense against emerging threats, preserving both the operational integrity and trust email provides.
