1) What happened: The Fancy Product Designer WordPress plugin, used for product customization on WooCommerce sites, is at risk due to two critical vulnerabilities discovered by Patchstack. These include an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload flaw (CVE-2024-51919) allowing remote code execution and an unauthenticated SQL injection flaw (CVE-2024-51818) risking database compromise. Despite being notified in March 2024, the vendor, Radykal, has not provided a fix, leaving users exposed even as Patchstack has published a detailed report of the flaws, potentially aiding attackers in exploiting the vulnerabilities.

2) Why it matters: This issue is significant because the vulnerabilities allow unauthorized users to execute malicious actions, such as uploading harmful files or compromising databases, affecting the security and data integrity of over 20,000 websites using the Fancy Product Designer plugin. With Patchstack's detailed information publicly available, the risk of exploitation is heightened, potentially leading to widespread attacks. Furthermore, the vendor's lack of response stifles trust and could allow cybercriminals to exploit sites, endangering user data, business operations, and customer trust.

3) Actions to be taken: Website administrators should immediately deactivate the Fancy Product Designer plugin to prevent potential exploitation. Consider employing security measures such as implementing strict file upload controls and proper input sanitization to reduce risks. As a proactive step, users should regularly update all plugins, monitor for any vendor response or updates, and consider using alternative, more secure plugins. It might also be wise to contact Radykal directly for updates and ensure the use of comprehensive security tools to detect and mitigate potential threats.
