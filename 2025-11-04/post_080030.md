Microsoft security researchers discovered a new backdoor malware known as SesameOp. It abuses the OpenAI Assistants API as a covert command-and-control (C2) channel, providing persistent access to compromised environments and enabling remote device management. The attack, uncovered during a July 2025 investigation, involved using legitimate cloud services to avoid detection. SesameOp employs an obfuscated loader and a .NET-based backdoor to maintain persistence through malicious processes and internal web shells. Importantly, the malware exploits no vulnerability in OpenAI’s platform, but instead misuses its capabilities.

The discovery of SesameOp is significant as it highlights a growing trend of cybercriminals leveraging legitimate cloud services to conceal malicious activity. This approach complicates detection and response efforts, illustrating the evolution of cyber attacks toward more stealthy and persistent threats. It emphasizes the challenge of distinguishing malicious from benign activity when legitimate APIs are used as part of the attack vector, posing a heightened risk for long-term espionage operations and data breaches.

To combat threats like SesameOp, it's crucial to implement additional network monitoring and auditing measures, such as scrutinizing firewall logs for abnormal activity and monitoring connections to external services. Enabling tamper protection, configuring endpoint detection in block mode, and maintaining vigilance for unauthorized API use are essential. Building capabilities for quick response to API misuse and collaborating with service providers to swiftly disable compromised accounts also enhances defenses against such sophisticated attacks.
