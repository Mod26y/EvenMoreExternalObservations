In this cybersecurity incident, threat actors have been manipulating freight brokers and trucking carriers by sending malicious links and emails. These links deploy remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools that enable the attackers to hijack trucks and steal cargo shipments. Since January, extensive campaigns have been recorded. Victims have spanned numerous countries, with a central focus in North America. Such attacks involve social engineering tactics to deceitfully access systems and impersonate legitimate carriers, reflecting a sophisticated exploitation of digital supply chains for physical theft.

The significance of these events lies in the integration of cyber and physical criminal activities, highlighting vulnerabilities in the digitized supply chain. With cargo theft losses in the U.S. estimated at $35 billion annually, these attacks stress the critical need for enhanced cybersecurity measures in logistics. Moreover, the incident underscores how cyber adversaries employ insider knowledge of industry operations to execute high-value thefts, posing significant economic and operational risks to targeted entities.

In response to this threat, organizations within the freight and logistics sector should enhance their cybersecurity posture by restricting the installation of unauthorized RMM tools and implementing vigilant network monitoring protocols. Moreover, robust email security practices, including blocking potentially dangerous file attachments like .EXE and .MSI at the gateway level, could mitigate similar attack vectors. Employee training to recognize phishing and social engineering attempts is essential, alongside incident response planning tailored to both cyber and physical aspects of supply chain security.
