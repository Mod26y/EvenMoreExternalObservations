A vulnerability in the Post SMTP WordPress plugin potentially allows hackers to hijack administrator accounts on over 200,000 websites. The flaw, identified as CVE-2025-24000 and rated at a high severity score of 8.8, is due to a broken access control mechanism in the pluginâ€™s REST API, granting logged-in users access to email logs without proper permission checks. Consequently, low-privileged users could initiate an admin account password reset and intercept the reset emails, gaining control over admin accounts.

This security flaw is significant as it highlights the risks of not verifying user permissions adequately, potentially resulting in the compromise of website administrators' accounts. Such exploits can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or even complete control over affected websites. As WordPress powers a considerable number of websites, the impact could be widespread, affecting both the sites' security and their users' data privacy.

Web admins using the plugin should prioritize updating to version 3.3.0 or newer to patch the vulnerability. They should also review user roles and permissions to ensure only trusted users access sensitive features. Additionally, monitoring for suspicious activity, particularly relating to password reset requests and email logs, is advisable to detect and respond to potential exploitation at an early stage. Regularly updating plugins and conducting security audits can mitigate similar risks in the future.
