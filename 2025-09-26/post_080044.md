**What Happened:** The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) mandated federal agencies to patch critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20362, in Cisco's Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) software. These vulnerabilities were actively exploited in zero-day attacks linked to the ArcaneDoor campaign, orchestrated by the UAT4356 threat group. The attacks utilized sophisticated evasion methods, targeting 5500-X series Cisco devices to gain unauthorized remote code execution and maintain persistence across system reboots through manipulation of read-only memory and deployment of malware like the LINE VIPER shellcode and GRUB bootkit.

**Why It Matters:** The exploitation of these zero-day vulnerabilities poses a significant threat to agency networks, potentially compromising sensitive data and disrupting operations. The targeted nature and persistence of these attacks highlight the evolving tactics of cyber threat actors, aiming to exploit critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. The attacks demonstrate the crucial need for proactive vulnerability management and the rapid deployment of patches to protect against potential unauthorized access and data breaches. Keeping systems updated with security patches is vital to maintaining the integrity and security of government networks.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:** Agencies should immediately inventory their Cisco ASA and Firepower devices to identify vulnerabilities. Devices showing signs of compromise should be isolated, and end-of-support devices should be removed from networks. Up-to-date patches must be applied to non-compromised devices, ensuring compliance with CISAâ€™s directive. It is also crucial to enhance monitoring and forensic capabilities to detect and respond to anomalies swiftly. Regular security assessments and updates to incident response plans should be conducted to better prepare for and mitigate future threats. Engaging in ongoing threat intelligence sharing with broader security communities can also improve collective defense strategies.
