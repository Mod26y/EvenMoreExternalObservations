Cisco revealed two zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-20333 and CVE-2025-20362, in their ASA and FTD firewall software, currently exploited in ongoing attacks. The first allows remote code execution by authenticated users, while the second allows unauthorized access to restricted URLs. A third vulnerability, CVE-2025-20363, was patched, enabling remote code execution without authentication. These vulnerabilities are being targeted, as evidenced by GreyNoise’s detection of increased probing activity on ASA and Cisco IOS devices prior to the patch announcement.

These vulnerabilities are significant as they affect critical infrastructure that safeguards enterprise and government networks. The exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system takeovers, severely impacting operational security. Cisco’s reliance on international cybersecurity alliances highlights the global nature of this threat and the critical importance of collaboration in addressing these challenges.

Organizations using affected Cisco products should promptly apply the recommended software patches to mitigate the vulnerabilities. Continuous monitoring for suspicious activity on ASA and IOS devices is advisable. Additionally, reviewing and strengthening access control measures can reduce the risk of exploitation. General awareness and adherence to cybersecurity best practices can further protect against related threats.
