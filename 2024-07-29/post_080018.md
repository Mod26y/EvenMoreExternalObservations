### 1) What Happened

Threat actors have been exploiting a misconfiguration in Selenium Grid, an open-source web application testing framework, to deploy a modified XMRig tool for mining the cryptocurrency Monero. Researchers at the cybersecurity startup Wiz discovered that this malicious activity, dubbed “SeleniumGreed,” has been operational for over a year. The attack leverages the lack of authentication in the default configuration of Selenium Grid, allowing unauthorized access and command execution. The attackers specifically target instances of Selenium that are publicly exposed, compromising environments to establish a reverse shell, deploy mining software, and use compromised servers as intermediaries for further command and control operations.

### 2) Why It Matters

This issue is significant for several reasons. First, Selenium Grid is extensively used in cloud environments and has over 100 million pulls on Docker Hub, indicating a large potential attack surface. The exploitation can lead to unauthorized resource consumption, which can degrade service performance and increase operational costs. Furthermore, the attackers could potentially deploy additional malware, posing a broader security risk, including data breaches and further compromise. The fact that the attack is operational even on the latest versions of Selenium Grid underscores the need for improved security configurations and practices in widely used open-source tools.

### 3) What Actions Should Be Taken

Organizations using Selenium Grid should review their configurations to ensure that authentication and network security policies are properly implemented, following Selenium’s official guidelines. Specific actions include enabling basic authentication, setting up firewalls to restrict access, and maintaining up-to-date instances with all relevant patches. Regular security audits and network scans should be conducted to identify and mitigate exposed instances. Additionally, monitoring for unusual resource usage could help detect cryptomining activities early, allowing for quicker remediation and reduced impact. Awareness training on secure configuration practices for development and IT teams can further help in preventing such vulnerabilities.
