### 1. What Happened

Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini disclosed a data breach incident involving its Automated Clearing House (ACH) service provider, which occurs between June 3 and June 7, 2024, and affected approximately 15,000 customers. Banking information, including full names, bank account numbers, and routing numbers, were compromised. No other sensitive information like social security numbers or passwords was exposed. Gemini has advised impacted individuals to remain vigilant against potential fraud, enable multi-factor authentication, and contact their banks for further protections. An investigation aided by external experts is currently underway to understand the incident fully.

### 2. Why it Matters

This incident is critical because it highlights the vulnerabilities arising from third-party relationships, especially in financial sectors dependent on secure transactions. The exposed banking details can be leveraged for fraudulent activities, affecting both the financial welfare of the customers and the reputational integrity of the involved organizations. The breach comes after a significant incident in 2022, accentuating the recurring nature of third-party risks. Breaches like this can cause a lasting loss of trust among customers and lead to potential regulatory scrutiny, legal repercussions, and financial liabilities for the organization.

### 3. What Actions Should Be Taken

Given this information, it is advisable for the steering committee to prioritize a comprehensive review of third-party risk management practices, including stringent due diligence and continuous monitoring of vendor security controls. Enhancing internal incident response protocols and customer communication strategies can mitigate potential fallout from future breaches. Additionally, implementing regular security audits and investing in advanced threat detection systems could substantially reduce the likelihood of similar incidents. Customers should be proactively educated on precautionary measures and offered robust protective services like identity theft protection to maintain trust and mitigate fraud risks.
