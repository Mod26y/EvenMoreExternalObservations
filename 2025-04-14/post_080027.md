**1) What happened:**

Microsoft is currently testing a new feature for its Defender for Endpoint security tool, which aims to automatically isolate networks by blocking traffic to and from undiscovered or unmanaged endpoints. This functionality relies on IP containment to prevent lateral movement by attackers, essentially stopping incoming and outgoing communications with devices that are not yet onboarded to Defender for Endpoint. The feature includes automatic attack disruption, automatically applying containment policies based on threat detection, and targeting specific network ports and communication directions to contain threats efficiently.

**2) Why it matters:**

The ability to isolate undiscovered endpoints significantly enhances an organization's cybersecurity posture by proactively addressing potential network vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by threat actors. By preventing the spread of attacks, particularly lateral movement within a network, organizations can better safeguard sensitive data and critical infrastructure from potentially devastating breaches. This proactive approach to endpoint security is particularly important as more enterprises face sophisticated cyber threats that leverage lateral movement to compromise an entire network.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should consider participating in the testing phase of this new Defender for Endpoint capability to better understand its impact and benefits. IT and security teams should review their current endpoint and network management policies and identify areas where automatic IP containment can improve their security posture. Continuous training and awareness programs for IT staff will ensure proper configuration and monitoring of this feature. Additionally, organizations could evaluate their overall cybersecurity strategies and consider integrating this functionality to bolster defenses against lateral network movement and reduce the risk of broader network breaches.
