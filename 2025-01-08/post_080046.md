In the latest cybersecurity event, a new Mirai-based botnet is targeting industrial routers and smart home devices by exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. Since its detection, the botnet has capitalized on vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-12856 in Four-Faith routers, and some undisclosed vulnerabilities in Neterbit routers and Vimar smart devices. It’s rapidly expanded to involve 15,000 daily active nodes, with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks aimed at diverse global targets. Exploits include both public and private vulnerabilities across devices from various manufacturers, facilitating the botnet’s growth and impact.

This development is significant as it demonstrates the evolving sophistication of botnets in exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities to infiltrate industrial networks. Attacks leveraging zero-days are particularly dangerous as they target unpatched vulnerabilities. Such efficiency in breaching systems indicates an elevated threat level for critical infrastructure, necessitating heightened vigilance. The high-intensity DDoS attacks, exceeding 100 Gbps, can severely disrupt even resilient infrastructures, highlighting the botnet's potential to cause significant operational damage.

In response, organizations should prioritize maintaining up-to-date firmware and software across all networked devices. Disabling unnecessary remote access and managing strong, unique passwords will reduce vulnerability. Network monitoring tools should be employed to detect unusual traffic and examine potential intrusion indicators. Establishing robust incident response protocols prepares institutions to act swiftly upon any detected compromise, minimizing downtime and mitigating damage effectively. Continuous education on the latest threats enables the security teams to adapt quickly to emerging risks.
