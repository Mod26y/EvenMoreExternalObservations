Illumina's iSeq 100 DNA sequencers are vulnerable to bootkit attacks due to outdated BIOS/UEFI firmware without write protections or Secure Boot. This flaw exposes the devices to attacks that could disable them, alter data integrity, or insert persistent backdoors. The iSeq 100's reliance on an OEM motherboard known for similar issues in other devices suggests wider risks across medical and industrial sectors. Eclypsium identified nine vulnerabilities in the sequencer, and Illumina has released a patch after being notified about the vulnerabilities.

The exposure of BIOS flaws in DNA sequencers is significant as these devices are pivotal in medical diagnostics and research. Exploiting these flaws can disrupt business operations, impact patient care, or serve nation-state interests, given the device's role in detecting genetic diseases and aiding in vaccine development. Such vulnerabilities highlight risks not just to Illumina devices but potentially affect other systems using similar components. Prompt assurance of device security prevents threats to genomic data integrity and helps maintain trust in medical technologies.

Organizations should assess the integrity of BIOS/UEFI firmware in their medical and industrial devices, ensuring it is up-to-date and, where possible, protected by Secure Boot features. They need to work closely with manufacturers to apply patches quickly and conduct regular vulnerability assessments. Additionally, organizations should follow established protocols for quick response and management of any emergent threats, including educating device operators on detecting potential security threats and integrating protective measures into their broader cybersecurity strategy.
