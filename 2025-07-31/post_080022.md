**1) What happened:**  
ShinyHunters, a cyber extortion group, has been linked to a series of data theft attacks on companies like Qantas, Allianz Life, LVMH, and Adidas. These breaches involved social engineering tactics, primarily voice phishing, targeting Salesforce CRM platforms. Attackers impersonated IT support to deceive employees into granting access via a fake "connection code," connecting a malicious app to Salesforce instances. The attacks have not yet resulted in public data leaks, but the group is extorting companies privately, threatening to release stolen information if demands are unmet.

**2) Why it matters:**  
These incidents highlight significant cybersecurity challenges for organizations using third-party CRM platforms. The involvement of an organized extortion group like ShinyHunters emphasizes the growing threat of social engineering and its potential to exploit trusted platforms like Salesforce. The breaches underscore the importance of strong security practices, as inadequate protection can lead to unauthorized access and data theft, impacting millions of customers and potentially causing financial and reputational damage to the affected companies.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result:**  
Organizations should enhance their security measures against social engineering threats by implementing rigorous employee training programs focused on recognizing and responding to phishing attempts. It's crucial to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and the principle of least privilege for all applications. Regular reviews of third-party CRM security configurations and limitations, such as enforcing trusted IP ranges and managing app permissions, should be conducted. Additionally, companies should appoint a designated security contact for incident communication and consider using advanced threat detection tools to monitor and respond to suspicious activities promptly.
