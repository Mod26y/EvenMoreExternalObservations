**What happened:** A recent cybersecurity threat involves attackers exploiting browser extensions to execute a "Man-in-the-Prompt" attack. This method allows attackers to inject malicious prompts into generative AI tools like ChatGPT, influencing the output without user consent. By manipulating browser extensions, which are often perceived as benign, attackers can alter the behavior of the AI tool, jeopardizing the integrity of the data being processed and potentially leading to unapproved data actions or leaking of sensitive information.

**Why it matters:** This vulnerability presents significant risks as generative AI tools are increasingly integrated into business processes and personal applications. The ability to manipulate these tools via browser extensions can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or modification of AI outputs, undermining trust in AI systems. Organizations relying on these tools for decision-making or processing confidential information could face compromised data integrity, leading to potential financial losses, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.

**What actions should be taken:** To mitigate this risk, organizations should evaluate and limit the use of browser extensions that interact with generative AI tools. Implementing security training and awareness programs can help users recognize potentially harmful extensions and phishing attempts. Additionally, IT teams can enforce stringent cybersecurity policies, ensuring company-approved extensions are verified and current. Regularly updating AI tools and extensions to patch vulnerabilities, combined with robust endpoint protection solutions, can enhance overall security posture against such emerging threats.
