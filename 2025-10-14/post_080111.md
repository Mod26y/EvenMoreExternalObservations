1) The article highlights the overlooked risk associated with 'back-office clutter' data within critical infrastructure organizations. These often neglected data sets, consisting of outdated or redundant information, can become prime targets for cyberattacks. Due to their non-primary status, they might not receive the same security measures as frontline data, making them vulnerable to breaches. A successful attack on these data reserves can indirectly jeopardize the integrity and security of the critical infrastructure they support.

2) This issue matters because it underscores a potential vulnerability within critical infrastructure sectors that can be exploited by cyber attackers. As these sectors are vital to economic stability and national security, even peripheral data breaches can result in significant consequences, including operational disruptions, financial loss, and threats to public safety. Recognizing and addressing these risks is crucial to forming a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy for defending essential services.

3) Actions to mitigate this issue include conducting comprehensive data audits to identify and catalog 'back-office clutter' data. Implementing robust security controls for these data sets, akin to those used for primary operations, reduces their vulnerability to attacks. Organizations should adopt a holistic approach to cybersecurity, integrating regular assessments and updates to handle outdated or redundant data effectively. Training staff to recognize the importance of securing all forms of data is equally critical in minimizing potential back-office data risks.
