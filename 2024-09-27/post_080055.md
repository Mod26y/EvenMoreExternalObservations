**1) What happened:**

Stellar Cyber, a security operations platform company, has announced a new initiative called National "Don’t Click It" Day, set for October 16, 2024, during National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. This day aims to educate the public, especially young people, on the dangers of cyber threats and phishing scams. The program, "Don’t Click It, Pitch It," teaches individuals how to identify and handle suspicious emails and messages to prevent scams. This initiative includes partnerships with various organizations and minor league baseball teams to spread awareness and bring cybersecurity education to youth.

**2) Why it matters:**

National "Don’t Click It" Day matters because it addresses the pervasive issue of phishing attacks and cyber scams, which are significant vectors for cybercrime. Educating young people and the general public on recognizing and avoiding these threats can drastically reduce the incidence of data breaches and financial loss. The emphasis on changing human behavior highlights a crucial aspect of cybersecurity that technical measures alone cannot fully address. By fostering awareness and caution in digital interactions from a young age, this initiative aims to create a more cybersecurity-aware generation, potentially reducing the overall success rate of cyberattacks.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

County information security steering committees could consider integrating similar awareness programs into their cybersecurity strategies, focusing on educating both the workforce and the community at large. Collaboration with schools and local organizations to provide educational resources and workshops on identifying phishing scams could enhance the public’s ability to defend against these attacks. Additionally, promoting and participating in National "Don’t Click It" Day activities could amplify the message's reach. Internal policies might also be reviewed to ensure that everyone is aware of best practices in handling suspicious emails and messages. Collecting and sharing examples of phishing attempts within the organization can also aid in identifying and thwarting such attacks.
