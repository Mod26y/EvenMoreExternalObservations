### What Happened

The "State of Cybersecurity 2025" report by CompTIA gathered insights from nearly 1,200 business and IT professionals globally and found a significant gap between the high priority placed on cybersecurity and the satisfaction with current efforts. While 98% of organizations see cybersecurity as a primary or secondary priority, only 25% believe the overall situation is improving dramatically, and just 22% are fully satisfied with their cybersecurity measures. The study points out the critical need for full organizational support, multifaceted cybersecurity expertise, and the integration of AI to both bolster defenses and counter AI-enabled attacks.

### Why It Matters

This disparity between cybersecurity's perceived importance and the effectiveness of current measures is concerning, particularly for public sector organizations like U.S. counties, which handle sensitive data and critical infrastructure. The findings highlight the necessity for a comprehensive approach encompassing technology, expertise, and organizational commitment. Understanding these issues enables counties to better allocate resources, implement effective training programs, and foster a cybersecurity-aware culture. Without this holistic approach, vulnerabilities will persist, potentially leading to severe data breaches or cyber incidents that could compromise public trust and operational integrity.

### What Actions Should Be Taken

As a result of this report, county information security leaders should prioritize fostering a culture of cybersecurity across all organizational levels. This involves increasing visibility and awareness among senior executives, implementing structured cybersecurity training, and encouraging certifications to build expertise. Allocating sufficient budgets to support these initiatives will be crucial. Additionally, integrating AI into cybersecurity efforts deserves attention, both for enhancing defenses and staying ahead of AI-enabled threats. By taking these steps, the county can move closer to aligning its cybersecurity priorities with effective and satisfactory outcomes.
