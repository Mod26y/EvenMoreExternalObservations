### 1) What happened

Security researchers identified severe vulnerabilities in Kia's dealer portal that could allow hackers to remotely locate, unlock, start, and control millions of Kia vehicles manufactured after 2013, using only the vehicle's license plate. These flaws also exposed personal information of car owners and enabled unauthorized addition of users to vehicles. The researchers accessed this critical information by registering a dealer account and obtaining an access token to the backend dealer APIs. Ultimately, they could manipulate the carâ€™s remote controls unnoticed.

### 2) Why it matters

This vulnerability is profound because it jeopardizes the physical safety and privacy of millions of vehicle owners. Unauthorized access to vehicles can facilitate theft or misuse, posing significant risks. Additionally, the exposure of sensitive personal information amplifies the likelihood of identity theft and privacy intrusions. Such systemic vulnerabilities in widely-used services erode consumer trust and highlight potential gaps in the cybersecurity practices within the automotive industry. Given that other car manufacturers faced similar issues in the past, this incident underscores a recurring vulnerability trend in connected vehicles.

### 3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information

In light of these findings, it would be prudent for automotive manufacturers to conduct comprehensive security audits of their digital ecosystems, including dealer portals, connected car services, and related APIs. Strengthening authentication methods, incorporating multi-factor authentication, and ensuring regular penetration testing can mitigate similar vulnerabilities. Additionally, it is advantageous to operate a well-publicized bug bounty program to encourage timely reporting and remediation of vulnerabilities. For consumers, awareness campaigns stressing the importance of software updates and securing their digital accounts associated with their vehicles can reduce risk exposure.
