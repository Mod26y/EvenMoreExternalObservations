1. **What Happened**:
OneTrust announced new capabilities for automating compliance with the EU's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), aimed to enhance resilience in the financial sector. These features include automated creation of DORA-specific reports, comprehensive risk and compliance data feeds, and tools for managing risks from fourth and nth parties (extended supply chain). The announcement highlights how these advances are integrated within OneTrust's Third-Party Management solution to provide end-to-end risk management, focusing on visibility, automation, and resilience of ICT services and supply chains.

2. **Why It Matters**:
As regulatory landscapes evolve, compliance becomes increasingly complex and critical, especially within the financial sector. DORA, taking effect in January 2025, mandates stringent operational resilience measures. OneTrust's new capabilities help organizations automate significant portions of compliance and risk management, reducing the burden on IT and security teams and minimizing human error. Effective implementation of these tools ensures that organizations can better withstand disruptions, manage third-party risks, and meet regulatory requirements, ultimately protecting consumer data and maintaining financial stability.

3. **Actions To Be Taken**:
Organizations should evaluate the new capabilities introduced by OneTrust for their potential to streamline DORA compliance efforts. Security teams could assess their current third-party risk management methodologies and consider integrating automated solutions like those offered by OneTrust. Increased visibility and automation tools should be leveraged to enhance ICT lifecycle management and resilience strategies. Additionally, participating in industry events, like the Gartner Security & Risk Management Summit, can provide deeper insights and hands-on learning opportunities, helping teams to better prepare for the upcoming DORA compliance deadline.
