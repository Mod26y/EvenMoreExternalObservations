Due to a restriction in accessing the specific content of the article, an accurate summary based on the exact article cannot be provided. Nonetheless, general insights on the topic of backdoored malware and its implications can be outlined for context.

1) What Happened:
Backdoored malware lures inexperienced cybercriminals by providing seemingly effective illicit tools, which are, in fact, designed to exploit those using them. Typically distributed in underground forums, these malicious software come equipped with hidden backdoors that allow the original creators to control or extract data from the systems it infects. Novice cybercriminals, who might lack the technical expertise to scrutinize these tools, often fall victim, unknowingly letting their operations be compromised or hijacked.

2) Why It Matters:
This situation highlights a twofold cyber threat: first, the development and availability of user-friendly tools that lower the barrier to entry into cybercrime, expanding the pool of active threats. Second, these tools undermine trust within the cybercriminal community through deception. This dual impact not only reveals a vulnerability within the criminal ranks but also highlights the sophistication and ruthlessness of malware creators who prey on their peers, further escalating cybersecurity dangers.

3) What Actions Should Be Taken:
Organizations should monitor threat intelligence reports to stay informed about emerging malicious tools and tactics used by cybercriminals. Investing in robust cybersecurity defenses, including endpoint protection, threat detection systems, and user education, can mitigate risks. Additionally, fostering law enforcement collaborations and reporting malicious activities can aid in dismantling these operations. Encouraging ethical hacking initiatives and cultivating cybersecurity skills within the community could counteract motivations fueling nascent cybercriminal activities.
