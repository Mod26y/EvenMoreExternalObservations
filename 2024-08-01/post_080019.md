### What Happened
DigiCert announced a mass-revocation of approximately 83,267 TLS certificates affecting 6,807 customers due to a domain control validation (DCV) non-compliance issue. The problem originated from a system update in August 2019 that caused validations without the required underscore prefix. Despite fixing the issue on June 11, it was only discovered on July 29. Affected customers must reissue their certificates by July 31, 19:30 UTC to avoid disruption. Critical infrastructure operators can request a delay if timely reissuance results in service disruptions.

### Why It Matters
This mass certificate revocation is significant as TLS certificates are essential for secure communication over networks, ensuring both data integrity and encryption. Failure to replace or reissue these certificates in time could lead to disrupted services for many organizations, potentially affecting critical sectors like healthcare, utilities, and financial services. It highlights the importance of rigorous compliance and swift incident response from certificate authorities. The issue also raises broader concerns about how system updates and validation processes are managed, emphasizing the need for stringent oversight in cybersecurity practices.

### Actions to Take
Organizations should immediately audit their TLS certificates through DigiCert CertCentral to identify if they are affected. Any impacted critical infrastructure operators should contact DigiCert by emailing delayed-revocation-request@digicert.com, providing necessary details for a delay. They should also prepare a transition plan to replace or reissue all concerned certificates by August 3, 19:30 UTC to avoid any service disruptions. Regular checks and updates to their certificate management and validation processes should be conducted to mitigate similar issues in the future. Additionally, organizations should stay informed via DigiCert and CISA advisories for any further updates or required actions.
