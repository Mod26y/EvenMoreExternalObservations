1) **What happened**: Microsoft released the KB5061087 update for Windows 10, version 22H2, as an optional non-security preview update. This update introduces multiple fixes, including resolving issues with the Start Menu and scanning on USB-connected multi-function printers. It also addresses a Component Object Model (COM) bug, updates the curl tool to version 8.13.0, and addresses issues with device registration, removal of language packs, and Oplock requests. While it includes several improvements, it has a known issue of causing CJK text blurriness at certain DPI settings in Chromium-based browsers.

2) **Why it matters**: This update is significant as it addresses key user-experience issues related to widely-used Windows 10 features, enhancing system stability and efficiency. Correcting bugs in essential functions like the Start Menu and printer scanning ensures smoother operations for businesses and individuals alike. Additionally, updating tools and resolving storage-related inefficiencies can lead to better overall performance and handling of resources. However, the introduced problem with CJK text might affect user experiences in specific regions, highlighting the importance of continual monitoring and feedback.

3) **What actions should be taken**: Organizations should weigh the benefits of these fixes against the potential drawbacks, particularly if using CJK languages. For proactive management, IT teams might install this update in non-production environments to evaluate its impact before wider deployment. It's essential to communicate the potential CJK issue to impacted users. Considering future dependencies, enrolling in programs like the Extended Security Updates could help extend support as Windows 10 nears its end-of-life. Organizations may pursue automated patch management systems to streamline similar updates and augment efficiency in their IT operations.
