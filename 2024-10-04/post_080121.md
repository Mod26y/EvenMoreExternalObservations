The recently identified Ivanti Endpoint Manager vulnerability, CVE-2024-29824, is a critical SQL Injection flaw allowing an unauthenticated network attacker to execute arbitrary code. Recognized by CISA in the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, this vulnerability poses a significant threat given its 9.6 CVSS score. Exploited in the wild, it has affected a limited number of Ivanti's customers. Despite security updates released in May, the vulnerability remains a critical threat, emphasizing the need for timely action to prevent severe outcomes such as data breaches or operational disruptions.

This vulnerability is crucial as it underscores the severe risk associated with unpatched systems within enterprise environments, where exploitation can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and disruption of business operations. Its inclusion in CISAâ€™s catalog highlights the anticipated potential for broader exploitation. Organizations using Ivanti EPM are notably at risk and must understand the critical nature of this flaw, which could lead to cascading impacts throughout affected networks and systems.
