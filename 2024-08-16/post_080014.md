### What Happened

The ransomware gang RansomHub has developed new malware called EDRKillShifter to disable Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) security software. This technique, known as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD), uses legitimate but vulnerable drivers to escalate privileges and deactivate security mechanisms. Sophos researchers discovered this malware during a May 2024 ransomware investigation. Despite multiple attempts to deploy the malware, the attackers failed to bypass Sophos's CryptoGuard feature. Two samples of the malware exploit drivers "RentDrv2" and "ThreatFireMonitor," both having proof-of-concept exploits available on GitHub.

### Why It Matters

This development is particularly concerning because it highlights the increasing sophistication of ransomware gangs and their ability to employ advanced techniques to disable security software. This can significantly undermine the effectiveness of existing defenses, making organizations more vulnerable to ransomware attacks. The malwareâ€™s ability to use legitimate but vulnerable drivers to escalate privileges and disable EDR processes underscores the need for continuous vigilance and proactive security measures. Failure to adapt to these evolving threats could result in severe operational disruptions and financial losses for targeted organizations.

### Actions to Take

Organizations should focus on enhancing their cybersecurity measures in light of this emerging threat. Enabling tamper protection features in EDR solutions can provide an added layer of defense. Maintaining strict separation between user and administrator privileges can help in preventing the loading of vulnerable drivers. Regularly updating systems and ensuring that EDR software is running the latest patches are essential steps to mitigate such risks. Monitoring for unauthorized driver installations and employing threat intelligence to stay updated on new vulnerabilities can also help bolster defenses against these sophisticated attacks.
