**What happened:**
A critical vulnerability, CVE-2024-28986, has been discovered in SolarWinds' Web Help Desk platform. This flaw is a Java deserialization remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, identified initially by researchers at Inmarsat Government. If exploited, it allows attackers to execute commands on the host machine. Despite SolarWinds' testing revealing that the vulnerability requires authentication to exploit, it remains critical. The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 score of 9.8, indicating its high severity, and a security patch is now available.

**Why it matters:**
The high CVSS score of 9.8 signals that this vulnerability is extremely severe, posing significant risks to organizations using the Web Help Desk platform. If left unpatched, it could allow unauthorized command execution, leading to potential data breaches, system compromises, and further infiltration by malicious actors. Given past incidents involving SolarWinds, such as the infamous supply chain attack, stakeholders are particularly sensitive to vulnerabilities within their software. Hence, addressing this threat promptly is crucial to maintaining enterprise security and operational integrity.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**
Organizations utilizing SolarWinds Web Help Desk should prioritize upgrading to version 12.8.3 and apply the available hotfix immediately to mitigate the identified RCE vulnerability. Conducting an internal review to identify any potential exposure is also advisable. Additionally, implementing continuous monitoring and reviewing system logs for any signs of exploitation attempts can help in early detection and response. Introducing robust patch management processes will ensure timely application of future security updates, reducing the risk of similar vulnerabilities.
