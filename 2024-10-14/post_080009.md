Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/google/google-warns-ublock-origin-and-other-extensions-may-be-disabled-soon/

**1) What happened:**  

Google announced the planned deprecation of the Manifest V2 (MV2) extension specification, impacting popular Chrome extensions like uBlock Origin, which rely on this older framework. Users are being warned that such extensions may be disabled to align with enhanced privacy and security practices, as Chrome transitions to the newer Manifest V3 (MV3) framework. Although Manifest V3 was introduced to improve performance and security, it poses challenges for developers requiring advanced capabilities. This has led to alternatives like uBlock Origin Lite, which offer limited functionality, prompting some users to consider switching browsers.

**2) Why it matters:**  

This matter is critical as it affects millions of users who rely on extensions like uBlock Origin for enhanced browsing experiences, such as ad blocking. Google's move to enforce the Manifest V3 framework highlights prioritization of security and user privacy, yet it comes at the cost of reducing certain functionalities essential for advanced users. The adjustments may drive users towards alternative browsers, impacting Chrome's user base and sparking discussions about browser control over what is essentially user-driven customization of their browsing experience.

**3) What actions should be taken:**  

Organizations and individual users should consider reviewing current extensions and identifying potential alternatives compatible with Manifest V3. It might be beneficial to stay informed about browser updates and policies regarding extension support. Furthermore, security teams should educate users on the implications of extension deprecation and explore policy options like the ExtensionManifestV2Availability policy to maintain necessary functionalities until suitable alternatives are in place. Understanding the impact on organizational workflows and preparing for a potential browser transition could also be prudent.
