**What happened:**  
Dark Reading, a cybersecurity news and information platform, is engaging its audience through a creative contest. They invite readers to submit captions for cybersecurity-related cartoons, offering a $25 gift card as an incentive for the winning entry. Last month's winner, Paul Mauriks, an ICT security specialist, was recognized for his caption, highlighting the community's creative involvement and engagement in cybersecurity discussions.

**Why it matters:**  
This contest fosters an interactive and creative approach to cybersecurity awareness, encouraging practitioners to think critically and humorously about scenarios they face. Such initiatives can enhance engagement within the cybersecurity community, driving home the importance of vigilance and innovation. They also offer a platform for professionals to share insights and perspectives, potentially influencing broader security culture and practices.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations could leverage similar creative engagement strategies to increase security awareness among employees, using humor and relatability to highlight key cybersecurity concepts and issues. Encouraging participation in such contests may help staff stay informed about current security trends and challenges. Furthermore, promoting an inclusive and interactive security culture could strengthen internal defenses by fostering open dialogues and diversified perspectives within the cybersecurity space.
