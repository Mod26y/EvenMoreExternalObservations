1) What happened: Microsoft has announced that Exchange Server 2016 and 2019 will reach end-of-support on October 14, 2025. After this date, Microsoft will cease providing technical support, bug fixes, or security updates for these versions. Customers using these versions are encouraged to take preventive measures to address the subsequent security risks. Options include migrating to Exchange Online or upgrading to Exchange Server Subscription Edition (SE), which allows for seamless in-place upgrades and offers ongoing support and updates.

2) Why it matters: The end-of-support for Exchange 2016 and 2019 has implications for cybersecurity posture, as unsupported systems may become vulnerable to security exploits without access to new security patches. This scenario increases the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and integrity loss. An active migration or upgrade plan helps ensure systems remain protected from emerging threats, maintaining the security and efficiency of communication infrastructure crucial for organizational operations.

3) What actions should be taken: The information security steering committee should prioritize planning for the transition from Exchange Server 2016 and 2019. Options include evaluating migration paths to Exchange Online or preparing for an upgrade to Exchange Server SE. IT teams should assess current configurations, compatibility, and potential impacts on existing operations. Comprehensive testing, employee training on new features, and constructing contingency plans to mitigate data loss or disruption during transitions will be essential for seamless adaptation to updated platforms.
