A new hacking group, the Belsen Group, has leaked sensitive information from over 15,000 FortiGate devices, including configuration files and VPN credentials. This data is freely available on the dark web, making it easily accessible to other cybercriminals. The leaked data appears to have been collected in 2022 as a result of exploiting a now-patched zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2022-40684, which allowed attackers to access config files and create rogue administrator accounts on vulnerable devices.

This leak is significant as it exposes a massive amount of sensitive technical information that can compromise network security for affected organizations, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access and attacks. The data includes VPN credentials, private keys, and firewall rules that can be used to infiltrate and manipulate networks. Although FortiOS updates have patched the original exploit, if credentials and configurations have not been changed since the data was collected, organizations remain exposed to potential breaches.

To address this issue, affected organizations should immediately assess if they are impacted by the leak. System administrators need to review and change VPN credentials and other sensitive information within their FortiGate devices if not done previously. Additionally, updating FortiOS to the latest version and revisiting security configurations may help protect against potential exploitation. Organizations are encouraged to monitor for any further notices regarding the leaked IP addresses to ensure they are not listed in the data dump.
