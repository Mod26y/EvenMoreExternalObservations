Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mikrotik-botnet-uses-misconfigured-spf-dns-records-to-spread-malware/

**1) What Happened:**

A botnet comprising approximately 13,000 MikroTik devices has been discovered utilizing misconfigured Sender Policy Framework (SPF) DNS records to distribute malware via email. This botnet exploits SPF records improperly set to use the "+all" option, which allows any server to send emails for the domain, facilitating spoofing and unauthorized email dissemination across 20,000 domains. The malicious campaign involved emails pretending to be from DHL Express, distributing ZIP files containing JavaScript and PowerShell scripts to establish contact with a command and control server associated with Russian hackers.

**2) Why It Matters:**

The exploitation of misconfigured SPF records to create a substantial botnet underscores the critical need for proper DNS security practices. The ability of threat actors to hijack such a large number of MikroTik devices and misuse them for diverse malicious activities, including DDoS attacks and data exfiltration, signifies a severe cybersecurity threat. The widespread botnet can amplify spam campaigns and other attacks, increasing their reach and potential impact. This highlights both the risk of poor configuration in network devices and the necessity for vigilance in maintaining cyber hygiene.

**3) What Actions Should Be Taken:**

Organizations should review and tighten their SPF configurations, ensuring the use of the more restrictive "-all" option, which confines email sending to specified servers. MikroTik device owners are encouraged to update device firmware promptly, change default administrative credentials, and disable unnecessary remote access. Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing can help identify configuration issues. Furthermore, security awareness programs could improve understanding of these vulnerabilities and management of network assets to prevent exploitation by cybercriminals.
