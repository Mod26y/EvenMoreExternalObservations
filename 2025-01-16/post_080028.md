In this cybersecurity event, CISA provided guidance on leveraging Microsoft's expanded logging features in Microsoft 365. This development was prompted by a significant breach by Chinese hackers (Storm-0558) who exploited a stolen Microsoft account key in 2021. These enhanced logging capabilities, which initially required premium licensing, are now available for free to standard customers with suitable licenses. The expanded logs facilitate detailed monitoring of events in services like Exchange Online and SharePoint Online, enhancing cybersecurity efforts particularly in detecting complex threats like Business Email Compromise (BEC) and advanced persistent threats.

This development is critical as it enhances organizations' threat detection and response capabilities, particularly against sophisticated threat actors. The breach underscored the importance of having robust logging and monitoring tools. Making these capabilities more accessible helps organizations better defend against advanced attacks, as seen when the State Department utilized enhanced logs to detect undetected activities by the hackers. It also addresses industry concerns over restricted access to necessary logs, promoting a more level playing field in cybersecurity resilience.

Organizations should evaluate their current logging capabilities and integrate the expanded logging features available in Microsoft 365 into their security operations. They should refer to CISAâ€™s 60-page playbook for best practices on utilizing these logs effectively. Additionally, they should configure Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems like Microsoft Sentinel or Splunk to receive and analyze these logs, enhancing their ability to detect and respond to threats efficiently. Regular training and updates for IT personnel on these new tools and features are also advisable to maintain a proactive security posture.
