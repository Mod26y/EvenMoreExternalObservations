**What happened:**  
The OWASP Foundation has updated its Top 10 list to address security threats posed by AI-generated code and generative AI applications. This list highlights emerging vulnerabilities in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as prompt injection, supply chain vulnerabilities, excessive privilege, and sensitive data exposure. The report emphasizes the need for improved risk management and secure coding practices, particularly as more organizations integrate AI-assisted coding tools into their software development processes.

**Why it matters:**  
The integration of AI in software development introduces new security challenges that can significantly affect the technology supply chain and enterprise data integrity. As organizations increasingly rely on AI, understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial to safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining trust. The potential for exposing proprietary data or inadvertently enabling business logic flaws underscores the importance of updating security practices to protect against AI-driven threats and ensuring tools are secure by design.

**Actions to be taken:**  
Organizations should prioritize enhancing both security awareness and technical skills among developers working with AI technologies. Implementing comprehensive threat modeling, robust access controls, and ongoing monitoring can mitigate risks associated with AI-generated vulnerabilities. Additionally, companies should ensure all employees are trained to handle sensitive data responsibly within AI applications. Continuous evaluation and adjustment of security strategies as AI technology evolves will be essential for maintaining application and data security.
