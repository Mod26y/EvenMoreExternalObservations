**What happened:**  
A crypto-mining campaign targeted Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts by exploiting compromised credentials rather than inherent vulnerabilities. The threat actor leveraged Docker Hub images to deploy mining software on Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Elastic Container Service (ECS) instances, exploiting users’ computing resources. They innovatively used the “ModifyInstanceAttribute” API to prevent administrative termination of instances, thus acquiring sustained unauthorized usage. Upon realizing the infiltration, AWS immediately notified affected customers and urged credential rotation. Despite taking down the malicious Docker image, there remains a risk of similar threats under new aliases.

**Why it matters:**  
The campaign illustrates the ongoing risk of crypto-mining exploits in cloud environments, particularly due to compromised credentials. Such unauthorized mining strains customer resources and incurs unplanned financial costs, affecting AWS’s reputation for security. The persistence technique used by the attackers to prevent shutdown complicates incident response and showcases the evolving tactics cybercriminals employ to maintain unauthorized access. Organizations dependent on cloud computing must prioritize identity and access management (IAM) security to thwart unauthorized access and resource exploitation.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations should quickly rotate and secure their IAM credentials, enabling multi-factor authentication and continuously monitoring credentials usage to detect anomalies. Regular audits and refining access controls can limit exposure. Deploying automated threat detection systems complementing AWS GuardDuty and educating employees on identifying phishing schemes will bolster defenses. It's crucial to foster a culture of proactive security awareness and adopt robust response plans to manage incidents efficiently. Remaining vigilant to repeated threats under new guises is essential, necessitating evolving security measures keeping pace with emerging tactics.
