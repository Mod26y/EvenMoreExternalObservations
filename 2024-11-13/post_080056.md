**What happened:**

Two zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft's software are being actively exploited in the wild. Microsoft released patches for these vulnerabilities as part of its November security update, which addressed 89 vulnerabilities, including a significant number of remote code execution flaws. The vulnerabilities under active exploitation include CVE-2024-43451, affecting NTLMv2 hash disclosures, and CVE-2024-49039, an elevation of privilege bug in Windows Task Scheduler. Several other vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed but not yet exploited, while many are deemed potentially appealing to threat actors.

**Why it matters:**

The exploitation of these zero-day vulnerabilities poses significant risks to organizations using Microsoft's software, as they can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or escalate privileges, potentially leading to further malicious activities, such as deploying ransomware or data exfiltration. The rapid adoption of the CSAF standard by Microsoft highlights the importance of timely vulnerability disclosure in enhancing organizational response mechanisms. As these vulnerabilities impact widely-used systems, there's a heightened urgency for organizations to ensure their systems are updated and secure against potential exploits.

**What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should promptly apply the patches released by Microsoft to mitigate the two actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities and any other critical updates. It's crucial to prioritize addressing remote code execution vulnerabilities, especially in critical components like Kerberos and the Visual Studio Code Python Extension. Additionally, leveraging Microsoftâ€™s CSAF-standardized vulnerability disclosures can streamline the integration of threat intelligence into existing security operations. A review of security configurations, particularly around Active Directory and certificate services, is advisable to close other potential exploitation avenues. Engaging in threat intelligence sharing and continuous monitoring would bolster defenses against these evolving threats.
