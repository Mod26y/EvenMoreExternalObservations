### What Happened

The Necro malware loader infected 11 million Android devices through malicious advertising software development kits (SDKs) embedded in legitimate applications available on Google Play. It particularly targeted popular apps and games like Spotify and WhatsApp. Kaspersky identified Necro in two significant apps, Wuta Camera and Max Browser, both of which have been since removed from Google Play. The malware executed various malicious activities, such as displaying adware, downloading and running arbitrary code, facilitating subscription fraud, and using infected devices as proxies.

### Why It Matters

The extensive reach of Necro demonstrates the critical vulnerability within the Google Play ecosystem and the high potential for widespread damage. Malware like Necro can have significant security implications, including unauthorized data collection, financial fraud, and the misuse of infected devices for further malicious activities. This highlights the necessity for stringent validation processes for apps and SDKs. For organizations and end-users, the risk presented by such infections calls for heightened awareness and proactive security measures, emphasizing the importance of mobile security and threat intelligence services.

### Actions to Be Taken

An immediate review of mobile app usage and permissions on organizational devices should be conducted, ensuring that any potentially compromised applications are removed. Enhancing the validation processes for both in-house and third-party applications used within the organization would be prudent. Implementing mobile threat defense solutions that can detect and mitigate such infections can bolster security. Continuous education and awareness campaigns should be carried out to inform users about the risks of downloading apps from unofficial sources and the importance of maintaining up-to-date security software. Both IT and security teams can benefit from closely monitoring threat intelligence feeds to stay informed about similar threats.
