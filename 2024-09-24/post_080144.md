### What Happened

The article discusses the increasing utilization of cyber ranges—simulated training environments—for improving cybersecurity skills among professionals. These ranges are managed by various organizations, including governments, universities, and private sector entities. Notably, the National Aviation University in Ukraine and the US Navy recently launched new cyber ranges. The SANS Institute also runs various cyber range competitions, such as NetWars, to keep cybersecurity professionals engaged and updated on the latest threats. Singapore's HTX agency and private companies like Critical Start are integrating these ranges into their training and operational frameworks.

### Why It Matters

Cyber ranges provide a crucial platform for cybersecurity professionals to practice their skills in realistic, controlled environments. Given the constant evolution of cyber threats and limited on-the-job learning opportunities, these environments help bridge the skill gap. The importance extends beyond training; it enhances national security by preparing personnel for real-world scenarios, thereby strengthening cyber-resilience. Additionally, the use of gamification in cyber ranges keeps training engaging, boosting learning retention and fostering a proactive cybersecurity culture. These initiatives are instrumental in maintaining a robust, updated defense against emerging threats, critical for both private and public sectors.

### What Actions Should Be Taken

The County should consider investing in cyber range technology or partnerships with organizations like SANS to provide continuous, hands-on training for its cybersecurity staff. Encouraging participation in competitions like NetWars can stimulate learning in a gamified environment, making it both effective and enjoyable. Integration of cyber range features should be explored in existing cybersecurity infrastructure to allow for real-time skill application and immediate feedback. Management may also evaluate the possibility of custom cyber ranges tailored to the County's specific security needs, ensuring the workforce is prepared for unique challenges they may encounter.
