1) Although the article's specific content couldn't be accessed, the title suggests a discussion around the lack of federal support in combating cyber threats, implying a growing reliance on local entities and organizations to manage their cybersecurity defenses. This situation likely points to local governments, businesses, and individuals shouldering greater responsibility for protecting against cyberattacks, in the absence of comprehensive federal intervention and resources.

2) This matter is significant because cybersecurity intrusions are increasingly complex and damaging, with threats ranging from ransomware to sophisticated nation-state attacks. By highlighting the absence of adequate federal support, it underscores the vulnerability of local systems and the potential repercussions on critical infrastructure and public safety. It calls attention to the need for heightened awareness, coordinated defense strategies, and potentially elevated investment in local cybersecurity measures to offset federal limitations.

3) Organizations and local governments could enhance cybersecurity by investing in robust security frameworks and fostering a culture of vigilance and rapid response preparedness. Awareness campaigns might be implemented to educate employees and stakeholders about emerging threats and cybersecurity best practices. Collaborating with cybersecurity experts and vendors to simulate attacks and stress-test systems might also strengthen defenses. Encouraging public-private partnerships can be a viable approach to share intelligence and resources, thereby improving collective resilience against cyber threats.
