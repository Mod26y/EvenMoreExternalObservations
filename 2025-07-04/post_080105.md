1) The article likely discusses how dark web vendors are increasingly targeting third-party suppliers and supply chains rather than focusing solely on individual organizations. This shift suggests that these cybercriminals see indirect routes as more viable entry points into target systems. By compromising supply chains, attackers can infiltrate multiple organizations through a single point of vulnerability. This marks a strategic evolution in cyber-attack methodologies, emphasizing the need for enhanced security measures along the entire supply chain.

2) This shift in tactic is significant because it broadens the spectrum of vulnerabilities that organizations need to consider. Attacks on supply chains can affect numerous entities and lead to widespread disruption, data breaches, and financial loss. Organizations typically have less control over third-party partners, which increases the risk. Moreover, these interconnected networks can spread malicious software quickly and harvest large amounts of sensitive data, potentially affecting everything from operational systems to customer information.

3) In response to this emerging threat, organizations should enhance their supply chain security by conducting thorough risk assessments and implementing stringent vetting processes for third-party vendors. Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities within the supply chain infrastructure is crucial. Additionally, adopting a zero-trust architecture can help mitigate risks by demanding strict verification processes for access across networks. Regular training and awareness programs for employees and partners about the potential risks of supply chain attacks can further fortify an organization's cybersecurity posture.
