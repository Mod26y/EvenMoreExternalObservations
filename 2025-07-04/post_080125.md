1) Apparently, attackers are impersonating well-known brands in attempts to execute callback phishing attacks. This suggests a tactic where attackers use social engineering to trick individuals into calling a phone number controlled by the attacker, under the guise of a legitimate service inquiry or verification process. This method is potentially more convincing as it exploits trust in recognized brands.

2) This development is significant because it highlights how attackers continually evolve techniques to bypass common security measures, leveraging brand trust. Such attacks pose a risk to organizations of all sizes, potentially leading to data breaches or financial losses due to the exploit of trusted communication avenues.

3) Organizations could benefit from enhancing awareness and training programs to educate employees on identifying phishing attempts, including less traditional methods like callback phishing. Additionally, review and enhance protocols for verifying communication sources, particularly those involving sensitive information requests. Implementing systems to detect and block such fraudulent activities and employing advanced email and call filtering technologies can also strengthen defenses against these tactics.
