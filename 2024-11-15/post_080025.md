1) What happened: CISA has issued alerts regarding two new vulnerabilities in the Palo Alto Networks' Expedition migration tool that are being actively exploited. These vulnerabilities, namely CVE-2024-9463, an unauthenticated command injection, and CVE-2024-9465, an SQL injection, could allow attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands with root privileges and access or modify database contents. This can expose sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and configuration data. Palo Alto Networks has released patches in Expedition version 1.2.96 and later to address these issues and recommended limiting network access as a temporary measure.

2) Why it matters: These vulnerabilities are significant because they permit unauthorized control over systems running unpatched versions of the Expedition tool, risking exposure of crucial data and severe network breaches. Given the tool's function in migrating configurations between major network systems, exploiting these flaws might compromise widespread infrastructure and security postures for organizations using affected systems. Additionally, because these vulnerabilities are being actively exploited, failing to address them promptly could lead to data breaches with potentially severe operational and reputational consequences.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations using the Expedition tool should prioritize updating to the patched version (1.2.96 or later) to safeguard against these vulnerabilities. For those unable to apply updates immediately, restricting access to the Expedition servers to only authorized users and applications is advised. Additionally, all usernames, passwords, and API keys for Expedition and affected PAN-OS firewalls should be rotated post-upgrade to minimize potential unauthorized access. Maintaining robust network monitoring for unusual activity and reviewing system logs can also help detect exploitation attempts. It's also essential to stay informed on related security advisories for ongoing threat intelligence and guidance.
