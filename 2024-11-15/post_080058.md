Researchers at Varonis identified a critical vulnerability in the PL/Perl language extension of PostgreSQL, allowing attackers to set arbitrary environment variables in PostgreSQL session processes. The flaw, tagged as CVE-2024-10979 with a high CVSS score of 8.8, enables threat actors to execute arbitrary code without requiring user-level access to the operating system. It also permits unauthorized query execution to extract potentially sensitive information. This vulnerability affects versions prior to PostgreSQL 17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, and 12.21.

This vulnerability matters because it involves a widely-used open-source database management system, PostgreSQL, which underpins numerous applications and infrastructures globally. An exploit could result in unauthorized access and control over affected databases, leading to data breaches or other malicious activities. The high CVSS score indicates a significant risk level that demands attention, as it could undermine the security integrity and confidentiality of data, potentially affecting business operations and compliance.

In response, organizations utilizing PostgreSQL should promptly upgrade to the latest minor version of the software to patch this vulnerability. Additionally, restricting the use of unnecessary language extensions and scrutinizing ddl logs for unauthorized function creations can help identify potential breaches. Regular security assessments and database monitoring during and after the update process contribute to maintaining database integrity and protecting against sophisticated threats.
