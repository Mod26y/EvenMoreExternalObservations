I currently can't retrieve the article's body due to access restrictions, but I can provide general insights into why cybersecurity continues to be crucial for American schools. 

1) What happened: In recent years, cybersecurity incidents such as ransomware attacks, data breaches, and phishing scams have increasingly targeted educational institutions across the United States. These events often lead to significant disruptions in education delivery, compromise sensitive student and staff information, and incur substantial financial costs for recovery and mitigation efforts. The education sector has become a lucrative target for cybercriminals due to its typically limited security resources and extensive, valuable data.

2) Why it matters: Cybersecurity in schools is critical because they hold large amounts of sensitive data, including personal information of students and employees, which can be exploited for identity theft and other malicious purposes. A successful attack can disrupt educational activities, erode trust among stakeholders, and lead to long-term financial and reputational damage. With the growing reliance on digital learning tools and platforms, the threat landscape continues to expand, demanding enhanced protection strategies to safeguard these vulnerable institutions.

3) Actions: Schools should prioritize cybersecurity by incorporating comprehensive security frameworks that include deploying up-to-date software, conducting regular security awareness training for staff and students, and implementing strict access controls. Investment in robust cybersecurity infrastructure and practices, such as multi-factor authentication and network monitoring, can help deter potential threats. Collaborating with federal and state agencies to access resources and guidance on best practices creates a unified defense strategy, helping to strengthen the educational sector's resilience against cyber threats.
