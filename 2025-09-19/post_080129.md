1) The original article's content is inaccessible, but the title suggests that there is an increasing trend where the boundary between cloud and edge computing is becoming a critical attack surface for cyber threats. This signifies that as more organizations adopt edge computing to enhance performance and scalability, they're inadvertently broadening their vulnerability landscape.

2) This development is crucial because it highlights a shift in how and where cybercriminals might focus their attacks. Since many organizations are adopting this hybrid model for better operational efficiency, it increases the number and variety of endpoints and potentially weakens the security infrastructure. Securing this evolving boundary is imperative for maintaining data integrity and protecting organizational assets.

3) Organizations should enhance their security measures by investing in robust endpoint protection and continuous monitoring systems that can manage this expanded attack surface. Implementing zero-trust architecture, where every access request is verified regardless of its origin, could reduce risks. Training staff to recognize and respond to security threats and periodically reviewing and updating security policies to adapt to new threats could support preventative efforts.
