Abandoned AWS cloud storage, particularly S3 buckets, pose significant cybersecurity risks as threat actors can re-register these resources under their original names. This can allow attackers to distribute malware or perform malicious actions when the abandoned buckets are still referenced in code by various organizations across sectors globally. The study by watchTowr highlights how basic and accessible such an attack vector is, demonstrating its potential ease and large-scale impact.

This vulnerability is critical because it could enable widespread, stealthy supply chain attacks similar to the SolarWinds incident, thereby compromising sensitive data or operations across numerous organizations, including government entities, major corporations, and financial institutions. This underscores the importance of robust cloud infrastructure management practices to prevent potential backdoors or unauthorized access via abandoned resources.

Organizations should audit and monitor their cloud resources regularly to ensure that no residual references exist in code or deployment scripts to abandoned storage buckets. Implementing stringent lifecycle management of cloud assets, alongside unique naming conventions for storage resources, can mitigate these risks. Additionally, engaging with service providers like AWS to explore solutions that prevent the reuse of previously deleted buckets can strengthen defense against such vulnerabilities.
