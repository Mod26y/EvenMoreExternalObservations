**What happened:**  
A phishing campaign targets the education sector by exploiting Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and hijack accounts. The attackers use deceptive emails to direct users to fake Microsoft ADFS login pages, capturing credentials and MFA codes, allowing them to conduct further malicious activities. The campaign primarily affects organizations with legacy systems and high user volumes, highlighting the weaknesses in older authentication infrastructures as they transition to modern, cloud-based environments.

**Why it matters:**  
The exploitation of ADFS underscores significant vulnerabilities in legacy authentication systems, particularly within sectors like education, healthcare, and government, which often have slower technology adoption. Successful account takeovers through such advanced phishing tactics can lead to widespread unauthorized access to sensitive information, disrupting operations and compromising data integrity. Organizations with such vulnerabilities face increased risks of data breaches, reputational damage, and operational setbacks if these security gaps are not addressed.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations should transition to more advanced identity platforms like Microsoft's Entra to enhance security. In the interim, implementing phishing-resistant MFA methods can help mitigate risks. Enterprises should bolster defenses using advanced email filtering, anomaly detection, and behavior monitoring technologies, alongside educating users on recognizing modern phishing techniques. These measures can help identify and mitigate attacks early, reducing the threat exposure from such sophisticated phishing campaigns.
