**1. What happened:**

A campaign linked to Russia is distributing the StealC V2 information-stealing malware using malicious Blender model files. These files, hosted on 3D model platforms like CGTrader, contain embedded Python scripts that execute if Blender's Auto Run feature is enabled. Upon execution, these scripts download a malware loader via Cloudflare, which subsequently retrieves malicious payloads, including the StealC infostealer and an auxiliary Python stealer. The payloads target sensitive data such as credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and communication platforms, while employing persistence techniques by placing LNK files in the Startup directory.

**2. Why it matters:**

The attack highlights vulnerabilities inherent in popular software like Blender when auto-execution features are used irresponsibly. As the malware can evade detection by anti-virus engines, it poses a significant risk to users who download 3D models without due caution. The campaign targets valuable personal and financial data, posing a threat to individual users and companies relying on 3D modeling for industries like gaming or animation. The sophisticated nature of StealC, with its expanded exfiltration capabilities across different applications, underscores the evolving challenge of securing digital environments against novel cyber threats.

**3. What actions should be taken:**

Blender users should disable the 'Auto Run Python Scripts' feature to prevent automatic execution of potentially harmful scripts. Users should treat 3D model files as executables and ensure they only download from trusted sources with a reliable reputation. When testing unknown 3D assets, users should employ sandboxed or isolated environments to mitigate risk. Additionally, regular updates to anti-virus solutions, emphasizing heuristic and behavior-based detection methods, should be encouraged to identify advanced malware like StealC more effectively. Educating users about these security practices is crucial to enhancing the overall cybersecurity hygiene of 3D model creators and consumers.
