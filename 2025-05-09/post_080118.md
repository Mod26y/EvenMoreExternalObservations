1) The article likely discusses a scenario wherein organizations have to navigate vulnerabilities without relying on the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system. This could involve alternative methods for tracking and managing vulnerabilities, which may emerge from issues like delays or limitations in CVE assignments. While we don't have the content of the article, the implied concern is managing cyber defense effectively without a standardized system.

2) Understanding the potential absence of CVEs is critical as CVEs currently play a vital role in identifying and communicating vulnerabilities across different systems and platforms. Without this central registry, organizations might struggle to prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities, likely resulting in increased exposure to cyber-attacks and exploitation due to insufficient or delayed communication of threats.

3) Organizations should reinforce and diversify their vulnerability management practices by integrating threat intelligence feeds from multiple sources. Adoption of internal vulnerability tracking and documentation processes could also help offset the absence of standardized CVE listings. Additionally, fostering community collaboration and sharing data on vulnerabilities outside traditional channels can support maintaining a proactive defense posture.
