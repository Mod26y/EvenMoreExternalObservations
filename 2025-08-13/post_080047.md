**1) What happened:** OpenAI introduced a new subscription plan called 'ChatGPT Go,' priced at 399 INR (approximately $4.55) per month. This plan is designed to expand capabilities beyond the free tier by offering enhanced messaging, uploads, image creation, and data analysis features, but is currently available only in select regions, likely targeting developing countries like India. The planâ€™s availability in other areas, including the U.S., remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Google is considering a similar low-cost offering for its AI service, Gemini, also focused on price-sensitive regions.

**2) Why it matters:** The introduction of a lower-cost subscription tier like ChatGPT Go represents a strategic move by OpenAI to increase accessibility to advanced AI features in developing regions where economic constraints may limit adoption. This potentially expands OpenAI's user base and aligns with efforts to democratize technological advancements globally. However, varying access to AI capabilities based on regional economic conditions may widen the technology gap between developed and developing countries. Observing how market competitors, like Google, respond could influence the dynamics of AI accessibility and market competition worldwide.

**3) What actions should be taken:** The information security steering committee should monitor the regional rollout of AI services such as ChatGPT Go to assess its impact on user engagement and data security. Evaluating the competitive response from other AI players can identify potential shifts in service offerings and pricing strategies. Reviewing the encryption and privacy policies associated with these new, lower-tier AI plans can ensure they comply with jurisdictional data protection regulations, particularly if expanded to regions like the U.S. Engage in discussions about the cybersecurity implications of integrating AI into existing systems to safeguard against vulnerabilities.
