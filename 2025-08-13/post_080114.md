1) Since full details of the article are inaccessible, based on the title, Charon Ransomware has emerged employing tactics akin to Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). This likely indicates the ransomware uses sophisticated and prolonged targeting strategies typically associated with state-sponsored or highly organized cybercrime groups to penetrate systems secretly and persistently, potentially causing significant damage.

2) The matter is crucial as it signifies a shift towards more sophisticated ransomware attacks, posing greater risks to organizations. APT-style attacks are challenging to detect and mitigate due to their stealth and persistence, demanding resources and capabilities often beyond traditional security measures. This evolution in criminal tactics could lead to higher stakes extortion and data breaches.

3) As a response, entities should enhance their cybersecurity measures by adopting advanced threat detection and response systems capable of identifying APT-like behaviors. Employee training on recognizing phishing and other social engineering tactics is essential, as is the secure backup of critical systems to mitigate ransomware impacts. Collaboration with cybersecurity experts and continuous monitoring for threats can further strengthen defense mechanisms.
