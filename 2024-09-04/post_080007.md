### 1) What happened:

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that losses from Bitcoin ATM scams in 2023 have skyrocketed to over $110 million, nearly ten times the amount lost in 2020. Criminals impersonate law enforcement or government officials to deceive victims, convincing them to deposit money into Bitcoin ATMs to supposedly protect their savings. These scams predominantly target older adults, with a median loss of $10,000 reported in the first half of 2024 alone. Once money is deposited and a provided QR code is scanned, the funds are irretrievably transferred to the scammers' cryptocurrency wallets.

### 2) Why it matters:

This significant rise in Bitcoin ATM scams highlights the growing threat of cryptocurrency-related fraud, particularly affecting vulnerable populations like older adults. The median loss of $10,000 indicates that these scams are not only widespread but also financially devastating. The increasing sophistication and audacity of these scams—coupled with the difficulty of recovering lost funds once transferred—pose a significant challenge for both consumers and law enforcement. Addressing this issue is crucial to protect public trust in both financial institutions and emerging financial technologies like cryptocurrency.

### 3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:

Educating the public about these scams is paramount. Awareness campaigns should be geared especially towards older adults, who are more susceptible to these fraud schemes. Public advisories should emphasize the importance of verifying any unsolicited messages or calls claiming to be from government or tech support. Financial institutions and businesses operating Bitcoin ATMs could collaborate to develop advanced warning systems, such as alerting users about potential scams during transactions. Additionally, law enforcement agencies could focus on tracking and dismantling sophisticated criminal networks perpetrating these scams, while also enhancing legal frameworks to better recover stolen funds.
