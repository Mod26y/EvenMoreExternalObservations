### What Happened

Clearview AI has been fined €30.5 million by the Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) for unlawful data collection practices. The company, known for its facial recognition technology, reportedly gathered biometric data from publicly available sources without obtaining proper consent from individuals. This unauthorized data collection violated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules that govern data privacy in the European Union.

### Why It Matters

This event underscores the importance of adhering to data protection laws, especially when handling sensitive information like biometric data. The significant fine levied against Clearview AI highlights the EU’s commitment to protecting citizens' privacy rights. For a large US County, this case serves as a precedent for the potential financial and reputational risks associated with non-compliance with data protection regulations, whether at home or abroad. Understanding and abiding by these regulations can prevent costly penalties and protect the organization’s reputation.

### What Actions Should Be Taken

The information security steering committee should consider reviewing and possibly enhancing the county's data protection policies to ensure compliance with national and international regulations. An audit of current data collection practices, particularly those involving sensitive information, can help identify and mitigate potential risks. Additionally, regular training programs on data privacy laws and ethical considerations for county employees could be beneficial. Engaging with legal and cybersecurity consultants to stay updated on the evolving landscape of data protection could also be a strategic move.
