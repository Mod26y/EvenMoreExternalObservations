**What happened:**
The City of Columbus, Ohio, experienced a significant ransomware attack in July, carried out by the Rhysida ransomware gang. The attackers leaked 3.1TB of stolen data, which included sensitive personal information. A researcher, David Leroy Ross, claimed the breach was larger than the city's disclosures suggested, which led to the city suing him. The city accused Ross of colluding with the ransomware gang and sought a restraining order to prevent him from accessing or disseminating the stolen data.

**Why it matters:**
This incident is significant because it highlights the broader implications of ransomware attacks on public institutions and the potential gaps in transparency when disclosing the scope of such breaches. The lawsuit against the researcher raises concerns about freedom of information and the balance between protecting sensitive data and maintaining public trust. It underscores the importance of timely and accurate disclosures about cybersecurity incidents to manage public perception and prevent secondary conflicts.

**What actions should be taken:**
The Countyâ€™s information security steering committee should prioritize implementing comprehensive incident response and communication strategies to ensure accurate disclosures. Strengthening relationships with cybersecurity researchers while developing clear policies on data handling and dissemination is essential. Additionally, offering support services such as free credit monitoring promptly after an incident can help mitigate the impact on affected individuals. It's also vital to regularly review and enhance cybersecurity measures to protect against ransomware and other related threats.
