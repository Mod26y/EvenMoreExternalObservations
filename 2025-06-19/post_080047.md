Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-365-to-block-file-access-via-legacy-auth-protocols-by-default/

**What Happened:**  
Microsoft has announced that starting in mid-July 2025, it will update security defaults to block legacy authentication protocols like RPS (Relying Party Suite) and FPRPC (FrontPage Remote Procedure Call) within Microsoft 365 environments. This move aims to prevent access to SharePoint, OneDrive, and Office files via outdated and vulnerable authentication methods. By default, Microsoft 365 tenants will block these protocols, addressing potential security vulnerabilities, and require admin consent for third-party app access, promoting a more secure and controlled file access environment.

**Why It Matters:**  
The transition to blocking legacy authentication protocols is crucial because these older methods are susceptible to brute-force and phishing attacks. Legacy protocols like RPS and FPRPC lack modern security advancements, making them prime targets for cyberattacks. By disabling these protocols, Microsoft not only helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches but also strengthens the overall security posture of countless organizations using Microsoft 365. Admin approval requirements for third-party apps help prevent data overexposure, aligning with best practices for cybersecurity resilience.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**  
Organizations should begin evaluating their use of legacy authentication protocols and transition to modern authentication methods. IT teams may need to audit their current system dependencies on RPS and FPRPC protocols to avoid disruptions. Additionally, administrators should prepare to configure app consent policies, ensuring any third-party applications needing access receive scrutiny and approval. Preparing for these changes ahead of the rollout will help maintain business continuity and secure critical data. Furthermore, organizations might benefit from reviewing Microsoft's guidance on admin consent and access policies to ensure compliance and optimal security configuration.
