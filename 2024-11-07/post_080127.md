The report highlights that attackers are increasingly targeting industrial control systems (ICS) and operations technology (OT) by initially breaching traditional IT networks. The SANS report indicates that a significant portion of these attacks are non-ransomware incidents, with common attack vectors being compromised remote services and internet-exposed devices. This trend demonstrates a concerning penetration strategy where adversaries use IT networks to access more crucial, and often less secured, OT environments. The finding underscores the reality that interconnected systems between IT and OT make industrial infrastructure a prime target for cyberattacks.

This matters because ICS/OT systems are crucial to critical infrastructure and any breach can lead to severe consequences, including operational disruptions, financial loss, and safety hazards. As these systems underpin industries like energy, healthcare, and manufacturing, any compromise can have severe societal impacts. The report also calls attention to the diversified methods employed by attackers, illustrating the urgent need for tailored countermeasures. Given the substantial risk even non-ransomware incidents pose, it remains imperative to reconsider and reinforce robust security postures for both IT and OT assets.

Based on these findings, organizations should consider enhancing their cybersecurity measures by conducting comprehensive risk assessments specifically addressing the interaction between IT and OT systems. Increasing visibility and monitoring across both networks and implementing stricter access controls can thwart unauthorized movements between IT and OT environments. Investing in employee training can help mitigate risks derived from social engineering attacks, such as spear phishing. Additionally, maintaining updated incident response plans that address potential disruptions in OT environments could significantly reduce reaction times during an actual event.
