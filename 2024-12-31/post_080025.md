1) **What Happened:** Threat actors are exploiting a remote command injection vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-12856, in Four-Faith routers. This flaw allows attackers to open reverse shells, providing them unauthorized access and potential control over affected routers. The exploit targets the 'adj_time_year' parameter via a crafted HTTP POST request, exploiting routers often configured with default, easily brute-forced credentials. While the issue was reported to Four-Faith by VulnCheck on December 20, 2024, it remains unclear if a patch has been released.

2) **Why It Matters:** This vulnerability poses a significant threat, especially since targeted routers are commonly used in critical sectors like energy, utilities, and telecommunications. A successful exploit could lead to severe consequences, such as unauthorized network access, data theft, and operational disruption in these industries. With thousands of these routers exposed online, the potential for widespread impact is substantial. Addressing this vulnerability is crucial to safeguarding against further exploitation and preventing the possible cascade of attacks on interconnected systems.

3) **What Actions Should Be Taken:** Users should immediately ensure that affected router models are updated to the latest firmware versions. It's critical to replace default credentials with strong, unique passwords to thwart unauthorized access attempts via brute force. Implementing the Suricata rule shared by VulnCheck could help detect and block exploitation attempts. Additionally, engaging with Four-Faith representatives or customer support for tailored advice and confirmation of available security updates is essential. Monitoring for unusual network activity and regularly reviewing security protocols will further enhance defense against potential exploits.
