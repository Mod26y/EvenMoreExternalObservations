**What Happened:** Microsoft alerted .NET developers to update their apps and developer pipelines due to the imminent shutdown of Edgio, a CDN provider responsible for "azureedge.net" domains. The affected domains, critical for downloading and installing .NET components, will become unavailable shortly. Developers using these domains for GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Docker, and scripts need to transition to new domains provided by Microsoft. As Edgioâ€™s services go offline due to bankruptcy, Microsoft is shifting its .NET delivery to alternative CDNs and new domain endpoints.

**Why It Matters:** This issue underscores the vulnerability of relying heavily on third-party service providers. The shutdown of Edgio threatens the stability of development environments and automated processes that depend on specific URLs for functionality. By proactively transitioning to new CDN domains, Microsoft is minimizing potential disruptions, which could lead to considerable downtime and developmental delays. The urgency of this migration is compounded as the announcement coincides with the holiday period when IT staffing levels are typically reduced, increasing the risk of oversight.

**Actions to Take:** Developers should promptly identify all references to the retiring domains within their code, scripts, and configurations, replacing them with the newly specified domain "builds.dotnet.microsoft.com." Additionally, teams should update CI/CD tools, such as GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps tasks, to versions supporting the new domains. Reviewing firewall rules to ensure the new CDN locations are not inadvertently blocked is critical for maintaining connectivity. Monitoring the GitHub page for updates will also help in tracking the migration status and resolving any issues that may arise.
