**What happened:** The APAC region is experiencing a rise in cyber threats, notably deepfakes and potential quantum attacks. Cybercriminals have been using AI to craft sophisticated attacks, including misinformation during political events via deepfakes and schemes involving large financial scams. Quantum computing developments are also alarming as they enable "harvest now, decrypt later" strategies, where data is collected now for decryption when quantum computing becomes more advanced.

**Why it matters:** These trends present significant threats to both private sector and governmental operations, potentially destabilizing critical communications, trust, and the secure retention of sensitive information. As AI and quantum computing capabilities advance, organizations—especially those handling sensitive or long-term secure data—face increased risks. This could compromise political stability and financial security in the APAC region, threatening global economic and security interests.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity posture by integrating AI-driven security solutions to counteract AI-adaptive cyber threats. Businesses should begin adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic systems and ensure compliance with evolving regulatory standards. Developing a comprehensive quantum-resistant strategy, including using stronger cryptographic libraries and quantum key distribution, can mitigate future vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing advancements. Adopting a unified security platform may improve situational awareness and streamline threat response capabilities.
