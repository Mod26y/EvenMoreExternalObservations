Organizations can leverage new features like enhanced Windows Hello for better security and efficiency. It is also recommended to stay informed about update needs and the rollout of fixes for reported issues to ensure secure and seamless operations. Consider evaluating third-party tools relying on legacy CPU usage metrics for compatibility with this update.
