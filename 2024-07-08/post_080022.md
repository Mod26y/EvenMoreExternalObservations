### What Happened

Cloudflare experienced a significant outage caused by a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijacking incident, compounded by a route leak affecting over 300 networks across 70 countries. The issue began when Eletronet S.A. announced the 1.1.1.1/32 IP address to its peers, which was more specific and thus favored over Cloudflare’s legitimate 1.1.1.0/24 announcement, causing misrouting and service disruption. A subsequent route leak by Nova Rede de Telecomunicações Ltda exacerbated the problem by misrouting even more traffic. Cloudflare detected the problem within approximately one hour, resolved the hijack two hours later, and addressed the route leak a few hours afterward.

### Why It Matters

This incident underscores the vulnerabilities inherent in BGP, which is a cornerstone of internet routing. BGP hijacking and route leaks can lead to significant disruptions, affecting critical internet services and potentially causing a cascading impact across the globe. In Cloudflare’s case, the disruption was relatively low-impact but highlighted the importance of secure and resilient network practices. Such vulnerabilities can be exploited for malicious purposes, including data interception, service denial, and traffic manipulation. This event indicates the urgent need for adopting more robust security measures to protect against BGP-related threats.

### Actions to Take

To mitigate the risks highlighted by this incident, the county’s information security steering committee could encourage the adoption of enhanced route leak detection systems incorporating diverse and real-time data sources. Promoting the implementation of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) for Route Origin Validation (ROV) can help in automatically rejecting invalid routes. The committee might also consider advocating for adherence to the Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) principles and recommend rejecting IPv4 prefixes longer than /24 to improve the security of the Default-Free Zone (DFZ). Moreover, exploring the potential implementation of emerging standards like ASPA objects and RFC9234 with Discard Origin Authorization (DOA) could also enhance routing resilience and integrity.
