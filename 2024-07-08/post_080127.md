1) **What happened**

Euro 2024, the ongoing football tournament, has become a target for heightened cybercriminal activity, particularly focusing on credential theft and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Over 15,000 credentials related to UEFA customers have been exposed on underground forums, with an additional 2,000 up for sale on the Dark Web. A notable DDoS attack disrupted the online broadcast of a Poland vs. Estonia match, allegedly instigated by Russia-linked hackers. This follows a historical pattern where major sporting events attract various types of cyberattacks, including targeted operations against the Summer and Winter Olympics.

2) **Why it matters**

The cyberattacks surrounding Euro 2024 emphasize the continued vulnerability of high-profile international events to cyber threats, showcasing how cybercriminals can exploit these events for espionage, financial gain, or geopolitical influence. The exposure of personal and corporate credentials could lead to broader cybersecurity incidents beyond the tournament, affecting businesses and personal accounts. Moreover, the rising trend of DDoS attacks poses operational risks to live broadcasts and digital infrastructure. Understanding the patterns and scale of these threats is vital to enhancing security measures for future large-scale events, such as the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics.

3) **What actions should be taken**

Organizations and individuals should reinforce best practices for cybersecurity, such as avoiding the reuse of corporate credentials for non-business services and implementing strong, unique passwords. Enhanced monitoring and threat intelligence gathering can help preemptively identify and mitigate potential attacks. Event organizers should coordinate with cybersecurity firms to deploy robust anti-DDoS measures and secure digital infrastructure comprehensively. Continuous awareness training for employees and the public regarding phishing, credential theft, and other cyber threats will further strengthen collective defense mechanisms. Additionally, international collaboration between governments and security agencies is crucial to mitigating state-sponsored cyber activities targeting such events.
