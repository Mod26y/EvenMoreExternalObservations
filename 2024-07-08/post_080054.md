### What Happened

A new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation called Eldorado emerged in March, targeting Windows and VMware ESXi virtual machines. The ransomware has already compromised 16 victims within the real estate, educational, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors, primarily in the U.S. Eldorado utilizes the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm, appending the ".00000001" extension to locked files, and deploying ransom notes to compromised systems. It also encrypts network shares via SMB and deletes shadow volume copies to prevent recovery. Customized attacks can be carried out by affiliates, and the ransomware can evade detection through self-deletion.

### Why It Matters

The emergence of Eldorado RaaS poses a significant threat to various sectors, including critical infrastructures like healthcare and education. By targeting both Windows and Linux systems, including virtualization platforms like VMware ESXi, Eldorado underscores the evolving sophistication and adaptability of ransomware tools. The rapid victimization evidenced by its short-lived operation indicates a potential for widespread damage, affecting data integrity, business continuity, and organizational reputations. The unique coding and self-deleting capabilities make Eldorado challenging to detect and mitigate, elevating the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures.

### Actions to Be Taken

Given the threats posed by the Eldorado ransomware, it is prudent to enhance cybersecurity defenses. Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and credential-based access can mitigate unauthorized access. Deploying Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems enables quicker identification and response to indicators of ransomware. Regular data backups are vital for minimizing data loss and ensuring rapid recovery. Utilizing AI-based analytics and advanced malware detection in real-time is crucial for efficient threat identification. Prioritizing security patches and conducting regular audits can reduce vulnerabilities. Employee training on recognizing threats will also build a culture of security awareness, potentially preventing initial infiltration.
