### What Happened

The article reports on an upcoming panel at Black Hat 2024 that will address AI safety, organized by Nathan Hamiel of Kudelski Security. The panel aims to dispel myths around AI safety and emphasize the vital role of organizations in ensuring the security and safety of AI systems. The conversation will explore the intersection between AI safety and security, stressing the importance of both technical and human harms under the SPAR (secure, private, aligned, and reliable) framework.

### Why It Matters

This focus on AI safety is crucial as AI technology becomes increasingly woven into everyday systems and decision-making processes. Most security professionals might overlook AI safety, assuming it's a concern for academics or governments. However, given AI's growing integration into critical applications, security professionals must also prioritize AI safety. This shift is crucial because an insecure AI system poses significant risks, potentially leading to technical failures and human harm. The panel aims to raise awareness, helping stakeholders understand their responsibilities and the need to integrate AI safety into their broader security strategies.

### What Actions Should Be Taken

Organizations should start by reviewing their current AI integration practices to ensure they align with the SPAR framework (secure, private, aligned, and reliable). Security professionals are encouraged to broaden their scope to include AI safety considerations, integrating these into their existing cybersecurity practices. Attendance at similar panels or discussions could provide valuable insights and practical steps to mitigate AI-related risks. Finally, businesses deploying AI should maintain accountability for their AI products' safety, ensuring that potential harms are identified and mitigated proactively. Engaging in continuous education and conversation around AI safety will be beneficial as this technology continues to evolve.
