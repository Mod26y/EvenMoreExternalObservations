Strong communication in cybersecurity is vital because it bridges the gap between technical understanding and actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders. This ensures that everyone, from executives to employees, is aware of their role in maintaining security. Clear communication builds trust with external stakeholders and is critical during security incidents. By effectively communicating risks and necessary actions, cybersecurity teams can mitigate vulnerabilities faster and more efficiently. This holistic approach fosters a culture of security, enhancing the organization's overall defense posture and reducing the likelihood of successful cyberattacks.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should prioritize the hiring and development of cybersecurity professionals with strong communication skills. Training programs focusing on effective communication, active listening, and collaboration should be implemented. Cybersecurity teams should be encouraged to simplify technical jargon and clearly articulate risks and mitigation strategies to non-technical stakeholders. Moreover, leveraging advancements in technology for vulnerability management can help shift the focus to communication and risk assessment. Regularly fostering interdepartmental dialogues and strengthening external communication will build a more resilient and security-conscious organizational culture.
