The DONOT Group, an advanced persistent threat (APT) group with links to India, has been found deploying two malicious Android apps, "Tanzeem" and "Tanzeem Update," to gather intelligence on individuals and organizations in India and South Asia. These apps masquerade as chat applications but secretly gain access to sensitive permissions once installed, allowing the group to collect call logs, contact information, and real-time location data. This highlights the ongoing regional threat from DONOT Team, which has used similar tactics against South Asian countries in its campaigns tied to geopolitical motives.

This event underscores the increasing sophistication and reach of threat actors in South Asia, particularly as geopolitical tensions continue to rise. The use of legitimate services like OneSignal for malicious purposes exemplifies the evolving nature of cyber threats, potentially impacting not only targets' privacy but also national security. By expanding their reach through mobile platforms, groups like DONOT are becoming a significant concern for governmental and defense organizations in the region and beyond.

Organizations should enhance their threat detection capabilities, specifically focusing on monitoring unusual app behaviors and permissions requests. Promoting mobile security awareness can help users avoid downloading fraudulent apps. Regular security audits on apps allowed in corporate or governmental environments can help identify potential threats. Collaboration between security vendors and government agencies is vital in keeping abreast of emerging threats from sophisticated actors like the DONOT Group, ensuring timely countermeasures and intelligence sharing.
