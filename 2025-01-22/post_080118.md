The article highlights the increasing adoption of digital identity systems with multifactor authentication and biometrics across the Middle East and Africa. Governments like Morocco and the UAE, along with companies such as the National Bank of Egypt, are implementing electronic identity cards and biometric-based identity verification. These efforts enhance cybersecurity measures by making digital services more secure and addressing the need for legal identification of over 540 million people in the region. Despite awareness and some progress, many organizations in these regions still lag in prioritizing investments in identity and access management technologies.

The move towards biometrics and multifactor authentication (MFA) is significant because it represents a crucial shift in enhancing cybersecurity frameworks in the Middle East and Africa. By leveraging smartphones and biometric data, these regions are tackling cybercrime and fraud while addressing the need for formal identity systems. The rollout of these technologies is vital due to prevalent cyber-risks and a substantial number of individuals without formal identification. As international concerns rise, strengthening authentication systems can have a considerable impact on reducing unauthorized access, thereby ensuring greater digital trust and safety for users.

In response to the developments in multifactor authentication and biometrics, organizations and governments could consider enhancing their IAM strategies, potentially collaborating on national initiatives where applicable. They should assess their digital infrastructure readiness to accommodate easy integration of biometric systems, keeping in mind the existing technology landscape and user mobility needs. Moreover, there needs to be a focus on raising awareness and investing in skilled talent to maintain and evolve these systems. This could involve training users on new authentication methods and integrating AI-driven identity solutions for improved security measures.
