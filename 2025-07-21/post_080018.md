1) Recently, Microsoft SharePoint servers experienced critical zero-day exploits identified as CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771, enabling remote code execution due to attackers bypassing prior fixes. Over 85 servers globally are compromised, and updates for some SharePoint versions are still pending. Attackers used techniques demonstrated at Pwn2Own Berlin, exploiting vulnerabilities to steal sensitive cryptographic materials for compromising systems further.

2) This situation is significant as SharePoint is widely used in organizational infrastructures, including government and private sectors. Active exploitation risks classified, financial, and personal data, potentially disrupting essential services. The absence of an immediate comprehensive patch increases vulnerability, particularly for on-premise servers, requiring vigilance and interim protective measures.

3) Organizations should swiftly apply available security updates for SharePoint and enable AMSI integration for enhanced threat detection. Implementing Microsoftâ€™s temporary mitigations, like disconnecting unpatchable servers from the internet and rotating ASP.NET machine keys, can prevent further attacks. Regularly monitoring IIS logs for indicators of compromise and conducting thorough investigations if detected can help manage ongoing risks. Additionally, continuous communication with security vendors and maintaining updated defenses against evolving threats is advised.
