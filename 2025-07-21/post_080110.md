My access to the specific content of the article is restricted due to a 403 error, so I will analyze generally based on the title and current knowledge of the subject matter.

1) What happened:
The article likely discusses strategies for security teams to address and minimize the chaos caused by agentic artificial intelligence (AI). Agentic AI refers to autonomous systems that can take actions or make decisions without human intervention. This situation might introduce risks and vulnerabilities if AI systems are compromised or behave unpredictably. The focus on "three ways" suggests actionable strategies to mitigate these issues.

2) Why it matters:
Agentic AI poses significant challenges because its autonomous nature can lead to unexpected behavior that might bypass traditional cybersecurity measures. This matters for organizations that increasingly rely on AI for critical functions. If these systems are not carefully managed, they can introduce new attack vectors, compromise data, or disrupt operations. Ensuring the secure integration and oversight of AI systems is crucial to maintaining organizational security and trust in AI technologies.

3) What actions should be taken:
Security teams should prioritize the implementation of robust AI governance frameworks to monitor and control AI activities. Risk assessments should be conducted regularly to understand potential vulnerabilities introduced by agentic AI. Additionally, enhancing transparency through AI explainability can help security teams better understand decision-making processes and spot anomalies. Ongoing training for staff on AI risk management and the development of incident response plans specific to AI-related threats would also be beneficial in staying ahead of potential issues.
