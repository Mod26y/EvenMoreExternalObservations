1. **What happened:** Security researchers at watchTowr discovered a significant vulnerability by successfully registering the expired domain **whois.dotmobiregistry.net** for $20. This domain was previously used as a WHOIS server for the .mobi top-level domain (TLD). Researchers were able to monitor over 76,000 unique IP addresses querying this outdated server, including government, military, and security-related entities. Furthermore, they found that some Certificate Authorities (CAs) still used this server for domain verification, highlighting a severe flaw that could be exploited maliciously.

2. **Why it matters:** This incident signifies a critical weakness in the Internet's infrastructure and trust mechanisms, particularly around WHOIS data and TLS/SSL certification processes. The fact that a decommissioned domain could still attract millions of queries, including sensitive and high-profile entities, underscores how outdated systems can create vulnerabilities. If exploited by malicious actors, such control could lead to the introduction of malicious payloads or the issuance of fraudulent certificates, potentially undermining secure communications globally.

3. **What actions should be taken:** Organizations should ensure their systems, especially those interacting with domain verification processes, are routinely updated to avoid relying on outdated infrastructure. Updating WHOIS queries to ensure they direct to current and authoritative servers is crucial. Certificate Authorities should review and improve their domain control validation processes to prevent relying on outdated WHOIS data. Additionally, broader scrutiny and modernization of the WHOIS system itself may be warranted to address inherent security weaknesses that could be exploited. Finally, continuous monitoring and validation mechanisms need to be in place for critical Internet infrastructure components.
