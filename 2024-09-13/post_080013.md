**1) What happened?**

In 2023, the FBI reported a record $5.6 billion in cryptocurrency losses from approximately 70,000 incidents, a 45% increase from the previous year. The primary driver was investment fraud, representing 71% of total losses. Other notable forms of fraud included tech support scams, call center fraud, and government impersonation. U.S. citizens bore the brunt of these losses, totalling $4.8 billion, mostly affecting residents of California, Texas, Florida, and New York.

**2) Why it matters?**

The stark rise in cryptocurrency fraud exposes significant vulnerabilities in the current financial landscape, especially given the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies which complicates fraud detection and recovery. These statistics indicate a growing trend that local governments and their citizens need to be aware of. The rampant increase in losses also highlights the immediate need for improved cybersecurity measures and education around safe cryptocurrency practices to protect individuals and businesses within the county.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Local government officials should initiate awareness campaigns to educate residents on identifying and avoiding cryptocurrency scams. Additionally, partnerships with financial advisors to help verify the legitimacy of investment platforms should be encouraged. Public services can consult with cybersecurity experts to implement best practices and use tools such as token allowance checkers to periodically review wallet permissions. For enhanced protection, recommend maintaining separate wallets for different activities and treating offers for "too good to be true" investments with suspicion. Regular training sessions for government employees on the latest fraud trends would also be prudent.
