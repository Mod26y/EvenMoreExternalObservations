1) **What Happened:** A new malware campaign is exploiting WordPress sites via a malicious plugin masked as a security tool. Discovered by Wordfence, the plugin provides attackers with persistent access, remote code execution, and JavaScript injection while remaining hidden from detection. It involves modifying the 'wp-cron.php' file to activate a plugin named 'WP-antymalwary-bot.php', along with others. If deleted, the system re-creates it on the next site visit. The infection likely results from compromised hosting or FTP credentials, with the C2 server traced back to Cyprus.

2) **Why It Matters:** This incident highlights vulnerabilities in WordPress sites, a widely used platform. Attacks enabling remote control and the execution of arbitrary code pose severe threats to site integrity, user data, and public trust. Such backdoor installations can escalate to broader impacts, like service disruptions, data breaches, and financial losses. Awareness of this threat is crucial for site administrators, as it not only affects website functionality but can also have ramifications for users exposed to redirected malicious content.

3) **Actions to Take:** Website administrators should regularly inspect 'wp-cron.php' and 'header.php' files for unauthorized changes. Deploying security solutions that monitor and analyze file integrity could help in early detection of such threats. Increasing vigilance regarding access logs for suspicious entries like 'emergency_login' could assist in identifying potential breaches. Moreover, site owners should ensure secure FTP practices and hosting account management to prevent initial footholds. Regular updates and backups can help mitigate the impact of such infections.
