**What happened?**
Multiple owners of Google Pixel 6 series phones (6, 6a, 6 Pro) reported that their devices became "bricked" after performing a factory reset. A factory reset typically erases all data and restores the device to its original settings, often in preparation for resale. Users encountered a missing 'tune2fs' file error during boot-up, leading to a recovery screen that prompts another factory reset, causing an infinite loop. With OEM locks preventing alternative troubleshooting methods, the cause remains undetermined. Google engineers acknowledged the issue and are investigating, but no resolution is yet available.

**Why it matters?**
This issue is significant as it not only disrupts users' ability to use their devices but also erodes trust in Googleâ€™s product reliability, especially with the problem arising just as many devices are exiting their warranty periods. For users participating in resellers' markets or those simply seeking to maintain functional devices, this software flaw could lead to substantial inconvenience and financial loss. Additionally, Google's delayed responses and lack of clear guidance exacerbate user frustration, thus highlighting underlying issues in their support and quality assurance processes.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**
Users of Google Pixel 6 series phones are advised to refrain from performing factory resets until a solution is provided. Keeping regular backups on a separate device can help mitigate data loss. Organizations should ensure their IT departments and help desks are informed about this issue to provide proper guidance to affected employees. Monitoring Google's public communications for updates and sharing any guidance with users as it becomes available will be crucial. Additionally, feedback regarding this problem should be shared with Google to stress the urgency of a solution.
