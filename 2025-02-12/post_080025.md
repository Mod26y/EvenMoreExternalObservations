Fortinet disclosed a vulnerability in their FortiOS and FortiProxy devices, CVE-2025-24472, which allows remote attackers to obtain super-admin privileges via crafted CSF proxy requests. This flaw exists in versions 7.0.0 through 7.0.16 of FortiOS and 7.0.0 to 7.0.19/7.2.0 to 7.2.12 of FortiProxy. Although initially it seemed like a new zero-day issue, it was later clarified as previously patched. The vulnerability, alongside CVE-2024-55591, was exploited to manipulate firewall settings and user accounts to create unauthorized access tunnels into internal networks.

This incident highlights the critical importance of timely and comprehensive patching for cybersecurity defenses. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and potentially compromise sensitive data and internal network infrastructure. This poses a significant risk to organizations that utilize Fortinet devices, leading to potential data breaches or disruptions. It emphasizes the need for heightened vigilance amid an evolving threat landscape, particularly with widely used security products like firewalls being targeted.

Organizations using vulnerable Fortinet devices should ensure their systems are updated to safe versions, specifically FortiOS 7.0.17 or higher and FortiProxy 7.0.20/7.2.13 or higher. If immediate updates are impractical, administrators can restrict management interface access to trusted IP addresses only or disable HTTP/HTTPS administrative interfaces temporarily. Continuous monitoring for signs of compromise is also advised. Engaging with threat intelligence and maintaining a well-informed IT security posture will help mitigate the risks associated with such vulnerabilities.
