India is experiencing a significant rise in cybercrime, with a sharp increase in cyber fraud against citizens and businesses facing more frequent attacks than the global average. More than 1.7 million cybercrime complaints were filed in 2024, a 54% rise from the previous year. The sources of these cyberattacks are both domestic and international, with a significant portion originating from countries like Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos. This trend highlights the vulnerabilities associated with India's rapid digitization of government and business services, making cybersecurity a pressing issue of national concern.

The increase in cybercrime in India is critical as it threatens economic stability, national security, and public trust in digital platforms. As India digitizes further, these threats are expected to rise unless addressed proactively. Moreover, the focus of cybercriminals has evolved to target mobile applications and associated APIs, which are integral to India's digital ecosystem. This shift underscores the importance of enhancing cybersecurity measures and infrastructure to protect against sophisticated and evolving threats, ensuring continued economic and technological growth.

To mitigate these risks, India is taking several actions, including creating exclusive domains for financial institutions, implementing a privacy and data-protection law, and cooperating with international partners like the US. Furthermore, the nation is ramping up efforts to train cybersecurity professionals and "cyber commandos" to strengthen defenses and handle investigations effectively. Continuous public awareness and skills development in cybersecurity can help build a more resilient digital environment. Investing in robust cybersecurity infrastructure and enhancing cross-border collaboration can further support India's efforts to counter rising cyber threats.
