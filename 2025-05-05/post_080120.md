I'm unable to directly access the contents of the article due to a 403 error, indicating that access to the URL is forbidden. However, based on the title, "Cut CISA and Everyone Pays for It," we can infer the potential issues discussed. Here's a general analysis based on the likely content:

1) **What happened:** The article likely discusses budget cuts or resource reductions for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). CISA is pivotal in protecting U.S. infrastructure against cyber threats. Reductions in their funding or resources could impair their ability to effectively manage and respond to cybersecurity threats which may lead to increased vulnerabilities within national infrastructure.

2) **Why it matters:** CISA plays a critical role in safeguarding national cybersecurity infrastructure and responses. Any reduction in its capabilities can have cascading impacts, compromising national and local cybersecurity. This situation matters because it directly influences the security of essential services, potentially leaving sectors more vulnerable to attacks. The repercussions could affect economic stability, public safety, and the U.S.'s overall defensive posture against growing cyber threats.

3) **What actions should be taken:** Stakeholders in both public and private sectors might consider advocating for sustained or increased funding for CISA. It's crucial to collaborate with government affairs teams to emphasize the importance of adequate cybersecurity funding in policy discussions. Additionally, local and national strategies should enhance existing partnerships with CISA to leverage resources effectively, ensuring robust defenses are maintained against the ever-evolving threat landscape.
