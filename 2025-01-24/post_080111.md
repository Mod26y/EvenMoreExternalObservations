Recently, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with DARPA, OUSD R&E, and the NSA, released a report emphasizing the need to improve understanding of software-controlled systems to ensure their functionality, safety, and security. Presently, technology outpaces the capability to thoroughly comprehend software, leading to exploitable vulnerabilities. The report calls for an urgent national effort to adopt secure design principles and highlights solutions such as formal methods for verifying software. This effort is crucial as state-sponsored entities increasingly target critical US infrastructure sectors, presenting urgent cybersecurity threats.

This initiative is crucial because it addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in software underpinning critical infrastructure like communications, energy, and transportation in the US, exacerbated by insufficient understanding of software complexities. The increasing incidence of state-sponsored cyber threats against these sectors impels a consolidated and strategic approach to bolster national cybersecurity measures. Enhanced software understanding will not only fortify these critical systems but also contribute to the US maintaining a strategic advantage in global cybersecurity and geopolitical contexts.

Organizations should consider enhancing their software development and assessment capabilities through strategic implementation of advanced verification techniques like formal methods. It's essential to foster public-private partnerships and encourage collaboration between government agencies and technology manufacturers to bridge the software understanding gap. Investing in training and resources to adopt Secure by Design principles will also be pivotal in mitigating risks associated with current and future software systems, ensuring they meet rigorous safety and security standards.
