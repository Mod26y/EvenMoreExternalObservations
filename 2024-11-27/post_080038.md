**1) What happened:**  
Malwarebytes, a well-established provider of cybersecurity solutions, has launched a Black Friday 2024 special offer, providing a 50% discount on a variety of its subscription services through December 8th. This promotion includes personal, family, and business subscriptions to their suite of security tools such as anti-malware software, VPN services, Identity Protection, and Personal Data Remover. The discount applies to both single and multi-year subscriptions, and to services protecting multiple devices. These offerings enhance protection against threats like ransomware, phishing attacks, and online scams.

**2) Why it matters:**  
Cybersecurity is increasingly crucial as more individuals and businesses face sophisticated online threats. The availability of discounted subscriptions for comprehensive security solutions such as those offered by Malwarebytes can make these essential protections more accessible. This is particularly important for addressing common vulnerabilities including zero-day exploits and unauthorized data access. Providing affordable access to expanded cybersecurity tools can help mitigate the risk of breaches and increase overall cybersecurity resilience for users during a season when cyber threats often rise.

**3) What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations and individuals should consider leveraging this promotional period to upgrade or expand their cybersecurity protections with Malwarebytes' suite of tools. Conducting an evaluation of current security measures can help determine if these offerings align with their needs. Furthermore, awareness campaigns could be initiated to educate users on the importance of multi-layered security defenses around holiday seasons, when cyber threats typically escalate. This is also an opportune time for businesses to reassess cybersecurity policies and encourage employees to adopt enhanced personal security practices at home.
