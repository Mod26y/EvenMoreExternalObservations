1) What happened: Microsoft has decided to cancel plans to implement a daily limit on the number of external recipients for bulk email sent through Exchange Online mailboxes. Originally, Microsoft announced in April 2024 that starting January 2025, this External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit would be set at 2,000 recipients per day for bulk senders. This decision was based on customer feedback indicating that the limit would create significant operational challenges. Microsoft plans to address abuse prevention while balancing usability and security by seeking less disruptive methods.

2) Why it matters: Microsoft's cancellation of the ERR limit on Exchange Online is significant because it reflects the need to balance spam prevention with business needs for large-scale email communication. The move acknowledges the operational challenges faced by organizations relying on bulk email, highlighting the importance of flexibility in cybersecurity measures. Additionally, it underscores the necessity of adapting security strategies to not unduly interfere with business operations, ensuring organizations can maintain effective communication while mitigating spam and security risks.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should continue to monitor Microsoft's communications for updated guidelines on email usage that prioritize security while accommodating operational needs. They can evaluate their bulk email practices to align with existing limits of 10,000 recipients and 5,000 external recipients per day, ensuring compliance. Collaboration with email service providers to maintain robust authentication methods, like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, can further enhance security. It's essential to remain adaptable to evolving best practices and explore preventive measures resonating with current email security challenges.
