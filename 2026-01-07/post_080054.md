**1) What happened:** A vulnerability identified as CVE-2026-0625 has been discovered in several legacy D-Link DSL routers, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to execute commands via improperly sanitized DNS configuration parameters. This issue impacts several models, including the DSL-526B, DSL-2640B, DSL-2740R, and DSL-2780B, which have reached their end-of-life and no longer receive firmware updates. VulnCheck reported the issue after observing an exploitation attempt in a honeypot. Both D-Link and VulnCheck are investigating further implications of this vulnerability, particularly regarding the scope of affected models.

**2) Why it matters:** This vulnerability poses significant security risks to users of the affected legacy routers as it allows for remote code execution, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over network environments. Given the routers' end-of-life status and lack of manufacturer support, users remain vulnerable to exploitation efforts that can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their network resources, especially if their devices are configured for remote administration.

**3) What actions should be taken:** Users should prioritize retiring and replacing affected end-of-life router models with actively supported devices from the vendor to ensure ongoing security protection. Meanwhile, legacy routers that must remain in use should be reconfigured to limit access, deployed in segmented networks, and operated with the most restrictive security settings. Organizations should also regularly update and review access policies to administrative interfaces to minimize attack vectors, and constantly monitor for signs of exploitation or unauthorized activity in network systems.
