### What Happened:

The Interlock ransomware group adopted a new social engineering tactic, FileFix, to deliver malware. Researchers observed this shift where hackers use trusted Windows UI elements like File Explorer to trick users into pasting malicious commands disguised as file paths. This method leads to the installation of a remote access trojan (RAT) on victim systems. The RAT is used to execute PowerShell scripts, gather sensitive information, and enable further command and control activities.

### Why It Matters:

This development is significant because it demonstrates an evolution in threat tactics, making detection and prevention more challenging. The FileFix method exploits user trust in familiar Windows interfaces, potentially increasing the success rate of these attacks. Given Interlock's history of notable targets like Texas Tech University and healthcare organizations, the shift to a stealthier attack vector poses heightened risks to both public and private sectors, emphasizing the need for enhanced user vigilance and updated security protocols.

### What Actions Should Be Taken:

Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity training, emphasizing awareness of social engineering tactics and the importance of verifying suspicious actions before execution. IT departments should monitor for unusual clipboard activity and implement security solutions that detect and block malicious PowerShell commands. Regular updates and patches on security software, alongside auditing of directory and file accesses, can reduce the risk of such attacks. Additionally, updating incident response plans to address evolving ransomware tactics will help mitigate potential damages.
