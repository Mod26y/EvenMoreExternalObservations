Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-kb5062554-update-breaks-emoji-panel-search-feature/

1) What happened: The Windows 10 cumulative update KB5062554 released in July 2025 inadvertently broke the search function of the emoji panel. Users are unable to search for emojis by name or keyword, instead receiving an error message indicating no results can be found. This issue has been confirmed by various users and the tech website BleepingComputer, affecting the usability of the emoji panel, although emojis can still be selected manually.

2) Why it matters: The disabled search function in the emoji panel affects user experience and productivity, particularly for individuals who heavily use emojis in communication. It highlights potential oversight in update testing, raising concerns about update quality. It is significant for IT departments and tech support as they field reports from users facing this issue. Additionally, with Windows 10 support ending in October 2025, issues like this could push users towards upgrading to Windows 11, aligning with Microsoft's strategic focus.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations should inform users of the temporary disruption in the emoji panel's functionality and provide alternatives or workarounds, such as manual emoji selection. Technical teams can monitor Microsoft's announcements for any updates or patches addressing the issue. In preparation for Windows 10's end of support, steering committees should evaluate and expedite their upgrade plans to Windows 11 or consider purchasing extended security updates to maintain compliance and security in their systems.
