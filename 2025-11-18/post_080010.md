**1) What happened:**

Microsoft has issued an emergency out-of-band update designated KB5072653 for Windows 10. This release addresses an error encountered by some users, specifically the 0x800f0922 installation error, when attempting to apply November's extended security updates (ESU). Windows 10 officially reached end of support in October 2025, prompting Microsoft to offer extended security updates for an additional cost to individuals and enterprises. However, customers have faced challenges in deploying these updates, necessitating this emergency release. The update also includes plans for a new Scan Cab to aid compliance checks.

**2) Why it matters:**

The installation issues with ESU updates are critical as they expose users to vulnerabilities by delaying or preventing the implementation of important security patches. For organizations relying on Windows 10 for operations, ensuring compliance and maintaining security standards are vital. The failure to install updates correctly could lead to security threats and non-compliance with regulatory requirements, ultimately impacting data integrity and organizational reputation. Addressing these errors quickly provides users continued protection against emerging threats during this extended support period.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

Organizations using Windows 10 should promptly install the KB5072653 update to resolve ESU installation issues. IT departments should verify that their systems are running Windows 10 22H2 with October 2025's KB5066791 cumulative update first. Post installation, a restart followed by checking for updates ensures proper implementation of the November security update. Enterprises should also monitor the release of the new Scan Cab for updated compliance checks, ensuring all devices receive necessary security patches. Participation in webinars or training on modern patch management could further enhance their update strategies.
