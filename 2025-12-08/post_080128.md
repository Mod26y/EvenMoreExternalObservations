**1) What happened:**  
Although the article content cannot be accessed due to a client error, the title suggests a discussion on the implications of quantum computing on cybersecurity strategies. It indicates a focus on questions Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) should consider, hinting at an analysis of how quantum advancements may affect standard encryption and cybersecurity protocols. This reflects a growing concern about the readiness of current security infrastructures to withstand quantum-based threats, highlighting the rapid advances in quantum technology.

**2) Why it matters:**  
The concern about quantum computing arises from its potential to disrupt current cryptographic techniques, potentially making existing encryption obsolete. As quantum technology develops, it could fundamentally alter cybersecurity landscapes, requiring new methods to secure data. For organizations like a US County, this is crucial, as safeguarding citizen data against advanced threats is a priority. Understanding and preparing for quantum-related risks now could inform better security decisions and ensure continuity in data protection as quantum technologies become more prevalent.

**3) What actions should be taken:**  
CISOs and security teams should stay informed about quantum computing developments and assess their potential impact on current security infrastructures. Engaging with experts in quantum-safe cryptography is advisable to explore more resilient cryptographic options. Additionally, conducting a comprehensive risk assessment to understand vulnerabilities related to quantum threats can guide strategic planning. It may also be beneficial to participate in industry collaborations and partnerships focusing on quantum research to enhance overall readiness and response strategies.
