### 1) What Happened

The U.S. Air Force has awarded Lineaje a Phase 1 Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) contract. Lineaje’s software supply chain security management tool, SBOM360, will be leveraged to enhance the U.S. Air Force's ability to identify and mitigate risks and threats in their software supply chain. This tool automates the detection and remediation of vulnerabilities, aligning with security policies and compliance mandates like Executive Order 14028.

### 2) Why It Matters

This development is significant because it addresses a critical vulnerability in software supply chains that adversaries frequently target. With over 75% of software supply chains exposed to cyberattacks in the past year and recovery times exceeding a month for 40% of organizations, the need for robust security measures is urgent. Employing SBOM360 will empower the U.S. Air Force to promptly discover and mitigate vulnerabilities, thereby fortifying national security and safeguarding sensitive information.

### 3) What Actions Should Be Taken

The County's information security steering committee should consider evaluating the benefits of employing a similar software supply chain security management tool like SBOM360. This assessment could include:

- Conducting a gap analysis to identify current vulnerabilities in the County’s software supply chain.
- Exploring partnerships or procurement of tools that offer comprehensive supply chain risk management, akin to SBOM360.
- Reviewing compliance mandates similar to Executive Order 14028, to ensure all security policies are rigorously adhered to.
- Instituting a continuous monitoring framework to promptly detect and mitigate any newly discovered vulnerabilities or indicators of compromise (IOCs).
