**1. What happened?**

Microsoft addressed a bug stemming from the June 2024 KB5039302 preview update which disrupted Windows Update automation scripts on Windows 11 systems, specifically affecting enterprise environments using the 23H2 and 22H2 versions. This bug resulted in empty query results and an error code 0x8002802B when calling methods on the `IUpdate` objects using the Windows Update Agent API. Microsoft resolved this issue using a Known Issue Rollback (KIR) feature and provided a Group Policy solution to be implemented by admins for immediate resolution.

**2. Why it matters?**

The bug impacted Windows Update automation scripts, potentially affecting the efficiency and security of enterprise IT environments that rely on automated update processes to maintain system compliance and security. The inability to run these scripts could delay essential security patches and system updates, exposing organizations to unpatched vulnerabilities and increased operational risks. Understanding and mitigating this issue is crucial to ensure that enterprises can maintain their patch management processes and overall system integrity.

**3. What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

IT administrators should apply the Known Issue Rollback (KIR) by configuring the relevant Group Policy on affected Windows 11 enterprise devices, targeting the specific impacted versions. This involves installing, configuring, and enforcing the KIR Group Policy to temporarily disable the change causing the script issue and restarting the devices to apply the settings. It is also advisable to monitor Microsoft's updates and information on subsequent patches for a permanent resolution. Regular communication with Microsoft's support resources and staying updated on future patches will help maintain smooth operation and security postures.
