**1. What happened?**

The Browser Company launched the Arc Bug Bounty Program following the resolution of a critical remote code execution (RCE) flaw, CVE-2024-45489. This vulnerability, found in the "Boosts" feature of the Arc browser, allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code on another user's browser by exploiting Firebase authentication. Once disclosed by a researcher, the flaw was swiftly patched, with the program now offering rewards for reported vulnerabilities to prevent similar future incidents.

**2. Why it matters?**

This incident underscores the criticality of continuous vulnerability assessment and prompt corrective actions within software applications. The RCE flaw could have facilitated mass-scale attacks impacting numerous users. By offering a bug bounty program, The Browser Company proactively engages the cybersecurity community, enhancing the browser's defense mechanisms and encouraging responsible disclosure, fostering trust and security consciousness among users.

**3. What actions should be taken?**

Organizations should take note and consider adopting similar proactive measures. Implementing bug bounty programs and conducting regular security audits can identify and mitigate vulnerabilities promptly. They should also ensure their software and systems are up to date with security patches. Additionally, an educational push towards coding practices with stringent emphasis on security, and a robust incident response framework, can significantly mitigate such risks. External audits, as demonstrated by The Browser Company, further strengthen the security posture by providing unbiased assessments.
