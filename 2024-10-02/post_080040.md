**1) What happened:**
Microsoft identified and addressed an issue affecting users of Outlook in Microsoft 365, where those with a large number of nested folders encountered problems sending emails. Users would receive Non-Delivery Reports (NDRs) with error code 0x80040305, making them aware that the email didn't reach some or all recipients. Microsoft has developed a fix for this issue, scheduled for release across various Outlook channels between October and December 2024. As a temporary measure, users are advised to reduce their nested folders to below 500 or collapse all mailbox folders.

**2) Why it matters:**
This issue is significant because it impedes the fundamental operation of email communication for affected users, leading to workflow disruptions. For organizations, especially large enterprises, timely and reliable email correspondence is critical for daily operations and productivity. The NDR notifications and temporary workarounds place a technical and administrative burden on IT departments, potentially hampering user efficiency and satisfaction. Considering the fix rollout timeline, impacted users and IT staff need to adopt interim solutions to maintain email functionality and prevent operational delays.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**
IT departments should immediately review the number of nested folders in users' primary Outlook mailboxes and apply the recommended workarounds, such as reducing nested folders below 500 or keeping them collapsed. Users should also be advised on how to avoid actions that exacerbate the issue, like extensive mailbox searches. Planning for the deployment of the upcoming fix is crucial, including testing the new versions in sandbox environments before full rollout. Continuous communication with users about the issue and interim solutions will help mitigate disruptions and maintain operational continuity until the permanent fix is in place.
