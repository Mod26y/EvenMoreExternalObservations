1) The issue involves training applications specifically designed to be purposely vulnerable for educational purposes. These apps are being left exposed on vendors' cloud environments, accessible to unauthorized individuals. This exposure presents a significant security risk as these apps can be exploited to compromise cloud environments, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further attacks on more secure systems.

2) This situation matters because it highlights a broader problem of security negligence and misconfiguration in cloud environments, particularly when training tools are involved. Such exposures can serve as an entry point for attackers to exploit further vulnerabilities, leading to potential loss of sensitive data, financial loss, and reputational damage to organizations hosting these vulnerable applications.

3) To mitigate these risks, organizations should ensure that all training applications and test environments are isolated from production environments. Implementing strict access controls, regular security audits, and continuous monitoring of cloud resources can help identify and address exposures. Additionally, security awareness training for developers and operations teams can reinforce the importance of securing test and training applications to prevent unintended exposures.
