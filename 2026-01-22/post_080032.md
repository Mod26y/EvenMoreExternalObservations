The Chainlit AI framework was found to have two critical vulnerabilities, termed 'ChainLeak,' which can be exploited to read any server file and leak sensitive data, such as API keys and authentication secrets. These vulnerabilities, identified as CVE-2026-22218 and CVE-2026-22219, enable arbitrary file reads and server-side request forgery in deployed internet-facing AI systems. With Chainlit being a widely used framework, these vulnerabilities pose a severe risk, potentially resulting in full-system compromise across industries utilizing the platform in production environments.

The discovery of these vulnerabilities is significant as they pose a substantial risk to both data confidentiality and system integrity, especially given Chainlit's wide usage in diverse sectors including large enterprises. The security issues provide an attack vector that could facilitate data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in cloud environments. Addressing these vulnerability issues is crucial to maintaining trust in AI systems which are increasingly integrated into critical operations and services.

In response to these vulnerabilities, organizations using Chainlit should prioritize upgrading to version 2.9.4 or later to mitigate the exploitation risk. Additionally, they may consider performing a security audit of their AI systems to identify any potential exposure or misuse of sensitive data. Implementing comprehensive secrets management and employing least privilege principles for accessing sensitive information might further enhance protection from future exploits of a similar nature.
