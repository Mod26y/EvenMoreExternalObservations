**1) What happened:** A wave of spam emails originated from unsecured Zendesk ticket systems, with reports starting on January 18th. This spam campaign exploits Zendesk's feature that allows unverified users to submit support tickets, generating confirmation emails to large recipient lists. The emails are misleading and strange, often mimicking law enforcement requests or takedowns. As they are sent from legitimate company systems like Dropbox and 2K, they bypass many spam filters, confusing recipients.

**2) Why it matters:** This incident highlights a significant vulnerability in customer support systems, showing how easily they can be exploited for spam campaigns. The abuse of legitimate platforms for spamming can erode trust in these systems and result in customers ignoring genuine communications. Although these emails aren’t typically malicious, their intrusive nature disrupts users and overwhelms communication channels. For organizations, this incident serves as a reminder of the importance of securing digital communication channels against misuse.

**3) What actions should be taken:** Organizations should assess their support systems' settings and consider requiring verification before ticket submission. Ensuring only verified users can create support tickets can prevent abuse. Monitoring for unusual activity and deploying constraints on ticket submissions can help detect and halt such spam waves. Additionally, educating users to be aware of this type of spam without causing undue panic is crucial. Zendesk users should implement these recommended security measures and stay informed about potential vector threats.
