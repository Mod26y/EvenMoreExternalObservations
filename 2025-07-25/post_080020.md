1) The newly introduced ChatGPT Agent mode is being rolled out for ChatGPT Plus subscribers at a $20 monthly rate, previously only available to $200 Pro plan users. This feature allows ChatGPT to perform tasks using its own resources, such as accessing calendars, planning meals, or creating presentations. It mimics human-like online navigation and can automate complex tasks end-to-end.

2) The release of Agent mode is significant because it enhances the capabilities of AI, making dynamic task-oriented interactions more accessible to a broader audience. This evolution raises the stakes for cybersecurity, as AI becomes more intertwined with users' personal and business activities, accessing, and possibly storing sensitive information online, which potentially increases exposure to cyber threats.

3) Organizations and users should carefully evaluate data privacy and security implications when using AI-driven tools like ChatGPT Agent. Regularly reviewing and updating privacy settings, limiting sensitive data access, and ensuring robust authentication for AI interactions can mitigate risks. Additionally, staying informed about cybersecurity measures deployed by service providers and considering additional layers of security, such as endpoint protection, can help bolster protections.
