**1) What happened:**  
ConnectWise released a security patch addressing critical vulnerabilities in its Automate platform, specifically targeting flaws CVE-2025-11492 and CVE-2025-11493. These vulnerabilities allowed data to be transmitted in cleartext over HTTP, which could be exploited through adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attacks to intercept and manipulate secure communications. Additionally, the absence of integrity checks for update packages posed risks for attackers to spoof legitimate updates. While cloud-based systems have been updated, on-premise users are advised to expedite updates.

**2) Why it matters:**  
The ConnectWise Automate platform is widely utilized by MSPs and IT departments, controlling operations across numerous client systems with high privileges. The discovered vulnerabilities can facilitate cyberattacks that intercept or manipulate sensitive information like credentials and updates. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to install malware under the guise of legitimate updates, potentially leading to widespread security breaches. Given the history of ConnectWise's vulnerabilities being targeted by nation-state actors, this issue poses a significant threat to organizations relying on their services.

**3) What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations using on-premise installations of ConnectWise Automate should prioritize updating their systems to the latest release, 2025.9, to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it's crucial for IT teams to verify that agents are configured to utilize encrypted HTTPS communications and implement robust checks for update file integrity, possibly including additional integrity verification mechanisms. Regular audits of cybersecurity practices and continual updates to security training for IT staff can further strengthen defenses against potential exploits.
