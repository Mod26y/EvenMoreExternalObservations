The focus is probably on the complexities of managing and safeguarding AI systems within organizations. As AI technologies advance, they often manage sensitive data and critical operations, raising concerns over who bears accountability for incidents or breaches. Such discussions are crucial as AI integration into business operations becomes more commonplace.
