**1) What Happened:**  
The article discusses the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into desktop applications, highlighting the emergence of Microsoft's 365 Copilot, Apple's Intelligence, and Google's developing Project Jarvis. These AI systems are designed to improve productivity by automating tasks and managing business information using large language models (LLMs). However, they raise security concerns due to potential data breaches, unregulated access, and exposure to various threats such as prompt injection attacks. Many businesses are cautious about deploying these technologies without addressing these weaknesses, with significant portions delaying their adoption due to security concerns.

**2) Why It Matters:**  
The growing integration of AI into business operations presents both opportunities for increased productivity and the risk of security vulnerabilities. AI systems, in accessing and managing sensitive data, lack traditional security controls akin to human oversight. This poses a threat not only through potential mishandling of data but also via exploitation by bad actors through social engineering attacks directed at AI. This situation underscores the necessity for new security measures, as failure to address these risks could lead to substantial breaches and compromise of sensitive information, affecting business integrity and regulatory compliance.

**3) What Actions Should Be Taken:**  
Organizations should focus on enhancing visibility and control over AI systems' actions. Implementing granular access controls can help manage the information AI systems can access and how they operate. Companies should develop robust security frameworks specific to AI, including measures against threat vectors like prompt injection attacks. Regular auditing and deploying monitoring tools like Microsoft Purview could help ensure compliance with data governance practices. Additionally, ongoing employee training and awareness programs should be established to help adapt to these new AI-integrated environments, ensuring security practices are well understood and followed.
