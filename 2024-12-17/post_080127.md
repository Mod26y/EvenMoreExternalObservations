**What happened?**

Zerto, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company, launched the Zerto Cloud Vault on December 12, 2024, enhancing cyber resilience through managed service providers (MSPs). This cloud-based, fully managed solution offers advanced security features, including logical air-gapping, immutability, real-time encryption detection, and clean room recovery capabilities. The offering aims to mitigate ransomware threats—a substantial financial burden for businesses—by providing tailored cyber resilience strategies. Partnering with MSPs like Assurestor and LincolnIT, the solution expands Zerto's cyber resilience portfolio beyond its self-hosted Cyber Resilience Vault, focusing on rapid data recovery and compliance with regulatory frameworks.

**Why it matters?**

The Zerto Cloud Vault is a significant development in cyber resilience, addressing the growing challenge of ransomware, a major disruptor for organizations with estimated hourly losses over $1 million during downtime. By offering a managed cloud solution, businesses gain access to cutting-edge ransomware defense technologies without directly managing complex cybersecurity infrastructures. This service not only promises quicker recovery times and reduced disruption but also extends compliance support, mitigating risks of legal fines. This highlights a strategic shift towards outsourced resilience solutions, emphasizing the critical role of MSPs in maintaining business continuity.

**What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Organizations should evaluate their current data protection and disaster recovery strategies to determine if a cloud-based cyber resilience solution like Zerto Cloud Vault meets their needs. Engaging with reputable MSPs can enhance their defenses against ransomware by leveraging state-of-the-art technologies offered by Zerto. Conducting a thorough risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities in existing systems, followed by planning frequent non-disruptive testing and training for incident response teams, can fortify defenses. Additionally, understanding compliance requirements to leverage such solutions effectively can reduce exposure to regulatory penalties post-attack.
