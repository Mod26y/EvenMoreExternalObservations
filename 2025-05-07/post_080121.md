1) Due to a lack of direct access to the article, one can infer that the piece likely discusses prevalent cybersecurity threats impacting higher education institutions. This sector often encounters risks like phishing attacks, ransomware, and data breaches. The article would detail specific examples or trends, explaining how educational institutions are targeted and affected by cyber threats, as well as exploring possible vulnerabilities within their systems that are frequently exploited by malicious actors.

2) Understanding cybersecurity risks in higher education is significant because these institutions store vast amounts of sensitive data, including personal information of students and faculty, intellectual property, and research data. Breaches can harm reputations, lead to financial losses, and disrupt educational operations. Recognizing these risks allows higher education institutions to prioritize cybersecurity measures, thereby protecting their communities and the valuable data they hold, which is crucial for maintaining trust and continuity in educational services.

3) As a response to these risks, higher education institutions should consider enhancing their cybersecurity posture by investing in robust security solutions and regular risk assessments. Implementing comprehensive security awareness training for staff and students can reduce the likelihood of human error. Additionally, developing and testing incident response and disaster recovery plans will better prepare institutions to respond effectively to incidents. Collaboration with cybersecurity experts and sharing threat intelligence with peers could further bolster resilience against evolving cyber threats.
