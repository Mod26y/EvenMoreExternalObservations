The cybersecurity incident involved threat actors exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-11371) in Gladinet's file-sharing software products, CentreStack and Triofox. This flaw allows attackers to access system files without authentication through a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. The exploitation of this flaw enables remote code execution by leveraging another older deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2025-30406). Researchers at Huntress discovered the exploitation in the wild and disclosed it to Gladinet. Since no patches are currently available, mitigations have been developed to prevent the exploit.

This incident is significant because Gladinet's software is used by thousands of businesses globally, increasing potential exposure and impact. The successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows unauthorized access and control over sensitive data, which poses serious security threats to affected organizations. The interconnected nature of file-sharing systems means any breach could be leveraged to access broader networks, thus escalating risks and potential damage.

Given this vulnerability, organizations using CentreStack and Triofox should consider implementing the provided mitigation steps to prevent exploitation. It is advisable to disable the temp handler in the Web.config file as per Huntress' guidance to thwart potential attacks. Additionally, organizations should closely monitor Gladinet's communications for updates regarding a permanent patch and apply it promptly once released. Enhancing continuous monitoring and adopting robust incident response plans can also be pivotal in managing similar risks.
