Over 10,000 Fortinet firewalls are currently vulnerable to exploitation due to an unpatched critical two-factor authentication (2FA) bypass vulnerability identified as CVE-2020-12812. This flaw allows attackers to gain access to firewalls without requiring a second authentication factor by altering the username's case, specifically affecting configurations with LDAP enabled. Despite Fortinet’s release of patches in 2020 to address this issue, a significant number of devices remain unpatched, leaving them susceptible to ongoing attacks by state-sponsored groups and ransomware actors as reported by Shadowserver.

The persistent exploitation of this vulnerability underscores the critical need for organizations to prioritize the patching of known vulnerabilities. Maintaining unsupported configurations and delaying updates can severely compromise security frameworks, resulting in unauthorized access and potential data breaches. With confirmed exploits in the wild, particularly with significant implications for U.S. networks, the situation emphasizes the broader cybersecurity risk posed by outdated systems within governmental and private infrastructures alike.

Organizations relying on Fortinet firewalls should immediately assess their systems for vulnerability exposure to CVE-2020-12812 and apply the recommended patches if they have not done so yet. Additionally, they should review and consider reconfiguring LDAP settings related to 2FA authentication to prevent unauthorized access. Continuous monitoring for security advisories and known exploits will also enhance an organization’s ability to respond promptly to emerging threats, thereby strengthening overall cybersecurity posture.
