Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/samsung-announces-major-security-enhancements-coming-to-one-ui-8/

**1) What happened:**

Samsung has announced new security and privacy features for its Galaxy smartphones with the rollout of One UI 8, enhancing protections through systems like Knox Enhanced Encrypted Protection (KEEP) and Knox Matrix, and adding quantum resistance to WiFi connections. KEEP creates isolated environments for encrypted app data, while Knox Matrix will automatically log users out if manipulation or identity forgery is detected, safeguarding against unauthorized access. Upgraded Secure WiFi incorporates post-quantum cryptographic resistance to shield connections from future threats. These updates will become available with Samsung’s latest Galaxy device launches and eventually to older models.

**2) Why it matters:**

These enhancements address growing concerns about data privacy and cybersecurity, particularly as AI tools become integral to daily smartphone usage. By encrypting app data and improving multi-device security, Samsung mitigates risks of unauthorized data access and manipulation. The introduction of quantum resistance to WiFi connectivity is particularly significant given emerging threats from quantum computing that could potentially decrypt current encryption standards. Strengthening these areas proactively positions Samsung as a leader in device security, which is crucial for consumers and enterprises that prioritize data protection amidst increasing cyber threats.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

To leverage these enhancements, users should upgrade to One UI 8 once available and familiarize themselves with the new privacy and security features. Organizations using Samsung devices can review and adjust their mobile security policies to align with the new capabilities, ensuring optimal protection across employee devices. Moreover, regular evaluations of security settings and the installation of the latest updates will help maintain a robust security posture. IT departments should also consider training sessions to educate users about Samsung’s advanced security features and the importance of data protection in an evolving threat landscape.
