**What happened:** Over the past year, there has been a significant increase in the number of malicious open-source software packages, with occurrences spiking by 188%. This trend has been identified in various open-source repositories where threat actors are embedding malware into these packages to exploit unsuspecting users and developers. The growing reliance on open-source solutions has inadvertently provided an attractive vector for cybercriminals targeting widespread software ecosystems and supply chains.

**Why it matters:** This surge in malicious open-source packages poses substantial risks to organizations that depend on these resources for developing software solutions. With open-source software forming the backbone of many technological infrastructures, an increase in software supply chain attacks can lead to compromised systems, data breaches, and organizational disruptions. The proliferation of these threats highlights the imperative need for organizations to critically assess and monitor their use of open-source components, ensuring that security is integrated into software procurement and development processes.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations should consider implementing robust supply chain security measures, including employing tools for automatic scanning and monitoring of open-source packages for known vulnerabilities or malicious code. Adopting secure software development practices and frameworks that prioritize comprehensive evaluation and vetting of open-source components can also be beneficial. Additionally, fostering collaborations with cybersecurity communities and initiatives can help in gaining access to threat intelligence regarding the latest security vulnerabilities affecting open-source ecosystems.
