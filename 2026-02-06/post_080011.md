Spain's Ministry of Science experienced a partial IT system shutdown due to a potential cybersecurity breach. A threat actor claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging they exploited an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data. The attacker leaked data samples, including personal records and email addresses, to underground forums, although the authenticity of these claims remains unconfirmed. The ministry has stopped numerous citizen and company services and suspended administrative procedures as a precaution, due to the extent of systems potentially impacted.

This incident underscores the vulnerability of governmental institutions to cyberattacks and the severe implications such breaches can wield. The affected systems host high-value, sensitive information vital to researchers, universities, and students, potentially compromising their data integrity and privacy rights. The breach highlights the growing threat from cybercriminals employing sophisticated methods, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity frameworks to protect sensitive governmental data from future breaches.

In response, the steering committee should consider enhancing security measures across all departments. Conducting a comprehensive risk assessment of current systems to identify vulnerabilities like IDORs is crucial. Investing in advanced threat detection and response tools, improving incident response protocols, and educating staff on cybersecurity awareness are vital steps. Additionally, regularly updating software and employing penetration testing can help prevent similar incidents, ensuring institutional data remains protected against future threats.
