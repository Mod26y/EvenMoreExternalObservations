1) Microsoft announced the planned shutdown of Exchange Web Services (EWS) API for Exchange Online by April 2027, after nearly 20 years of service. Starting October 2026, the EWS will be blocked by default, with a phased approach allowing temporary access through an application allowlist. Organizations using Exchange Online must transition to the Microsoft Graph API, while on-premises EWS functionalities will remain unaffected.

2) This shutdown matters as it impacts organizations relying on EWS for integration and automation tasks. The transition to Microsoft Graph, which is considered more secure and scalable, aligns with modern security requirements. Organizations using Exchange Online need to adapt to avoid disruptions and ensure compatibility with new security standards.

3) Organizations should begin evaluating their current EWS dependencies and develop a transition plan to migrate to the Microsoft Graph API. Testing the Microsoft Graph in existing applications and ensuring compatibility will help mitigate disruptions. Additionally, administrators need to monitor Microsoft’s ongoing communications regarding EWS shutdown specifics and participate in any "scream tests" to uncover hidden dependencies early in the process.
