**What happened:** La Sapienza University in Rome suffered a cyberattack believed to be a ransomware incident linked to the pro-Russian group Femwar02. The attack disrupted IT systems, leading the university to shut down its network to protect data integrity. It impacted over 112,500 on-campus students, causing significant operational issues. Restoration efforts are underway, involving Italian cybersecurity agencies. Malware analysis suggests the use of Rorschach ransomware, noted for its rapid encryption capabilities. While backups appear secured, there's a risk of data being sold or leaked, despite no confirmed access to the ransom request by university staff.

**Why it matters:** This incident highlights the increasing threat of targeted ransomware attacks on educational institutions, reflecting broader trends in cybersecurity where critical operations are disrupted, potentially halting educational processes. With universities being large data repositories containing sensitive information, such attacks pose significant risks to both individuals and institutional credibility. Additionally, this case underscores the importance of effective communication strategies and incident management protocols to maintain stakeholder confidence and minimize disruption in a high-volume learning environment.

**What actions should be taken:** Institutions, including those in the US, need to prioritize regular backup and testing strategies, ensuring offline storage to protect against ransomware. Enhanced endpoint detection and real-time monitoring tools can help identify threats early. Universities should develop comprehensive incident response plans, including alternative communication strategies to update stakeholders during crises. Educating staff and students on cybersecurity best practices, including recognizing phishing attempts, can mitigate additional risks. Collaborative efforts with national cybersecurity agencies can offer layered defense strategies, as seen in La Sapienza's response efforts with Italian authorities.
