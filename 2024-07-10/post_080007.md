**1. What happened:**
A joint international law enforcement operation, led by the U.S. Justice Department, dismantled an AI-powered bot farm operated by affiliates of the Russian state-run news organization Russia Today (RT) and a Russian FSB officer. This operation disrupted nearly a thousand Twitter accounts and two domains used to register these bots. The bots, created using AI software named Meliorator, impersonated real people to spread disinformation aligning with Russian propaganda since 2022, targeting users worldwide and aiming to influence public opinion in favor of Russian geopolitical narratives.

**2. Why it matters:**
This incident highlights the increasing sophistication and scale of disinformation campaigns facilitated by AI technology, which can manipulate public opinion on a global scale. The operationâ€™s success underscores the emerging threat of AI-enabled disinformation tools that can create convincing fake personas en masse. For a large US County, understanding the capabilities and reach of such operations is crucial for preparing defenses against misinformation campaigns that could influence local public sentiment, elections, and trust in governance.

**3. What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**
The Steering Committee should prioritize enhancing cybersecurity measures, including monitoring for sophisticated AI-generated disinformation campaigns. Partnering with federal agencies and leveraging their intelligence can improve early detection and response strategies. Public awareness campaigns about recognizing and reporting suspicious social media activity could also be beneficial. Additionally, investments in AI and machine learning tools to detect and counteract fake accounts can fortify defenses against similar threats, ensuring the integrity of information disseminated within the county.
