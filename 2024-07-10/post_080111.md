**1) What happened:**
The SANS Institute released its 2024 SOC Survey, presenting crucial insights into the operational dynamics, technology utilization, staffing, and performance metrics of Security Operations Centers (SOCs) worldwide. Key findings include the prominent use of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) technology and challenges with AI Generative technologies in SOC environments. Additionally, thereâ€™s a noticeable decline in TLS interception, potentially impacting visibility into encrypted communications. The survey emphasizes the importance of SOC reports for risk assessment, regulatory compliance, and business continuity.

**2) Why it matters:**
This survey is critical because it highlights the evolving landscape of SOC technologies and practices, guiding organizations on what tools and strategies are most effective in defending against sophisticated cyber threats. The prominent role of EDR and the challenges with AI Generative technologies suggest focal points for investment and improvement. The decrease in TLS interception is concerning as it may lead to blind spots in threat detection. The trend insights and metrics are vital for SOC resource justification and enhancing overall cybersecurity measures, directly contributing to an organization's resilience against cyber incidents.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**
Organizations should consider leveraging the survey insights to benchmark their SOC capabilities and identify areas needing improvement or investment. Particular attention should be given to integrating EDR solutions effectively while exploring the practical applications of AI Generative technologies cautiously due to current integration challenges. The decline in TLS interception necessitates revisiting policies and tools to ensure comprehensive visibility into encrypted traffic. Additionally, regular SOC performance metrics should be communicated to senior management, ensuring continual support and resource allocation for robust cybersecurity operations.
