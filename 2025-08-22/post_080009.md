1) The article discusses a case where a software developer was sentenced to four years in prison for creating a "kill switch" in their former employer's systems, which allowed the individual to remotely disable critical operations. This act of sabotage disrupted business operations and highlighted the vulnerability of relying heavily on a single insider with extensive system knowledge. Such malicious behavior illustrates the potential consequences of privileged access misuse.

2) This incident underscores the significant risks associated with insider threats and the importance of implementing robust access controls. It highlights how a single disgruntled employee can cause substantial damage to an organization's operations and reputation. The case serves as a cautionary tale for organizations to continually assess the trustworthiness of employees with access to critical systems and to ensure adequate monitoring and auditing of system activities.

3) Organizations should consider conducting regular audits of access privileges to ensure that only necessary personnel have access to critical systems. Enhanced monitoring and logging of employee activities involving sensitive systems can help in early identification of any suspicious behavior. Additionally, implementing redundancy in critical roles and systems ensures that no single employee can singlehandedly cause significant disruption. Employee exit protocols should also be rigorously followed to ensure the removal of all access rights immediately upon termination.
