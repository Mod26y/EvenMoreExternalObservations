The ShadowRay 2.0 campaign exploits an unfixed vulnerability, CVE-2023-48022, in Ray Clusters to hijack systems for cryptomining and other malicious activities. Attackers utilize AI-generated payloads to infiltrate vulnerable Ray infrastructures, executing unauthorized jobs that spread malware and mine Monero currency. Beyond cryptomining, stolen credentials, data, and DDoS attacks are part of their exploitative repertoire. Growing at a concerning rate, over 230,000 Ray servers are potentially susceptible to these attacks, highlighting neglected patches due to Ray’s deployment in trusted environments, contrary to real-world exposure where they are ungated online.

This campaign matters because it exploits AI technology for criminal gain and indicates a shift in how cyber-attacks can autonomously evolve and spread across widespread exposed infrastructures. The expansion of this exploit can lead to significant economic and operational damages for organizations relying on Ray Clusters. The campaign further underscores a critical need for heightened cybersecurity measures around evolving AI technologies, emphasizing the importance of securing open-source frameworks that support advanced applications.

To counteract ShadowRay 2.0’s threat, organizations using Ray Clusters should adhere to best practices set by Anyscale, ensuring that systems are deployed in secure, trusted environments. Implementing additional security layers like firewall rules, security group policies, and authorization mechanisms for Ray Dashboard ports can help thwart unauthorized access. Continuous monitoring for unusual activity within AI clusters and adhering to recommendations for deploying Ray in controlled networks will further insulate systems from these autonomous infiltration campaigns. Establishing dedicated monitoring and incident response for unauthorized activity should also be considered essential.
