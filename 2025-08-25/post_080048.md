**What happened:**  
Operation Serengeti 2.0, led by INTERPOL, resulted in the arrest of over 1,200 suspects in Africa involved in cross-border cybercrime. Conducted between June and August 2025, the operation targeted cybercriminals engaged in activities like ransomware, online scams, and business email compromise, affecting nearly 88,000 victims globally. Authorities dismantled over 11,000 malicious infrastructures and seized approximately $97.4 million. This operation was part of a broader African Joint Operation against Cybercrime, which drew support and data from 18 African countries, the United Kingdom, and various private cybersecurity firms.

**Why it matters:**  
This operation is significant due to its scale and the continued prevalence of cybercrime in Africa, highlighting vulnerabilities in global digital infrastructures. The collaboration marks a successful international effort to combat increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, demonstrating the importance of cross-border cooperation. It reflects the growing impact of cybercrime on a global scale, affecting multiple sectors, individuals, and organizations. Such efforts are crucial to disrupt criminal networks, protect victims, and prevent the financial and data losses that can severely impact communities and economies worldwide.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Following the operation, heightened vigilance and investment in cybersecurity measures seem prudent. Organizations could enhance their cybersecurity frameworks, focusing on incident detection, response capabilities, and employee awareness to combat threats like ransomware and phishing. Collaborations between law enforcement, governments, and private sectors are vital for intelligence sharing and rapid response. Regular security audits and adopting robust cybersecurity protocols may also be beneficial. Furthermore, support for international coalitions working against cybercrime could facilitate more successful operations and strengthen global cybersecurity defenses.
