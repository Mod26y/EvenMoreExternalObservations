**1) What happened:** The August 2025 Windows security updates, specifically KB5063878 for Windows 11 and KB5063709 for Windows 10, have caused significant performance issues for users utilizing NDI streaming software. These updates led to severe lag, stuttering, and choppy audio/video transmission when using NDI for streaming purposes. This problem primarily affects streaming applications, such as OBS, especially with 'Display Capture' enabled. The NDI team confirmed that the update's issues are related to RUDP connections, while others like UDP and Single-TCP remain unaffected. A temporary solution involves changing the NDI Receive Mode to use TCP or UDP.

**2) Why it matters:** These streaming issues are critical for users who rely heavily on NDI for professional audio/video streaming and broadcasting. The disruptions can affect workflow, productivity, and service delivery, especially for content creators, broadcasters, or anyone reliant on smooth streaming operations. Furthermore, the underlying performance problems signify potential broader stability issues with the security updates, potentially impacting other aspects of the system's function and leading to user dissatisfaction or workflow interruptions.

**3) What actions should be taken:** Impacted users should implement the temporary workaround by adjusting the NDI Receive Mode to either TCP or UDP to circumvent the performance issues while awaiting Microsoft's fix. Organizations reliant on streaming should consider holding off on these updates where feasible until a stable update is released. Itâ€™s crucial to maintain open communication channels with Microsoft for further updates. Regular reviews and updates of system patches will ensure a stable operational environment and prevent potential system disruptions due to unexpected update issues.
