The Internet Archive's "The Wayback Machine" experienced a data breach resulting in the compromise of a database with 31 million user records. Visitors to the site saw a JavaScript alert from the hacker, and the stolen data, which includes email addresses and bcrypt-hashed passwords, has been shared with the "Have I Been Pwned" service. The breach appears to have occurred around September 28th, 2024. The breach highlights vulnerabilities in major digital archival services and poses a significant risk to users' online accounts due to potential password exposure.

This breach is significant because it impacts a large number of users from a globally recognized digital repository. The compromised credentials, even though hashed, could lead to unauthorized access to users' accounts on multiple platforms if similar passwords are used. This event underscores the importance of robust security measures and the prompt management of security incidents to protect sensitive user data, maintaining trust in widely-used public digital platforms.

As a response to this breach, affected users should be informed to change their passwords, particularly if reused elsewhere. It's advisable for the Internet Archive to conduct a comprehensive security assessment to identify and rectify vulnerabilities, thus preventing future breaches. Moreover, implementing multi-factor authentication can provide an additional layer of security for users. Transparency with users about the breach and ongoing communication regarding their security policies would help to rebuild trust and enhance public confidence.
