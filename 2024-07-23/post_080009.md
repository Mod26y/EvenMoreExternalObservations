### 1) What happened

The Land Registry agency in Greece experienced a limited-scope data breach after enduring over 400 cyberattacks within a week. Hackers compromised employee terminals and stole 1.2 GB of data, which primarily consisted of administrative documents and did not include citizens' personal information. The attackers also tried to gain access to the central database and its backups but were largely unsuccessful in exfiltrating further data. No evidence of ransomware was found, and measures such as password resets and the implementation of two-factor authentication were quickly enacted to mitigate the risks.

### 2) Why it matters

This incident underscores the persistent and multifaceted nature of cyber threats to governmental agencies, highlighting vulnerability in even seemingly well-protected systems. Despite the relatively limited impact, the breach exposes potential weaknesses that could lead to more severe consequences if not promptly addressed. Additionally, the high frequency of attacks indicates that public sector organizations remain prime targets for cybercriminals. The scenario serves as a crucial reminder for continual vigilance, updated cybersecurity practices, and rapid response capabilities to mitigate potential damage.

### 3) What actions should be taken

In response to this incident, it is essential for the county's information security steering committee to review and potentially enhance current cybersecurity protocols, especially focusing on key aspects like endpoint security and employee access controls. Conducting comprehensive risk assessments and penetration testing could help identify other potential vulnerabilities. Training programs for staff on recognizing and responding to cyber threats should be intensified. Collaboration with external cybersecurity agencies may boost detection and defense mechanisms. Regular reviews and updates to incident response plans ensure preparedness for any future attack attempts, maintaining operational resilience.
