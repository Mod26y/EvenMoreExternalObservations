1) **What happened:**
EC-Council launched eight new "Cybersecurity Essentials" courses on July 17, 2024, aimed at democratizing the development of technical cybersecurity skills. Priced at $299, these courses target entry-level learners and professionals seeking foundational cybersecurity knowledge across eight critical domains, such as ethical hacking, network defense, and cloud security. Each course includes comprehensive educational materials, practical exercises, and final challenges to ensure participants gain hands-on, industry-relevant skills.

2) **Why it matters:**
This initiative addresses the widening global cybersecurity skills gap, expected to reach a shortfall of 3.5 million workers by 2025. By making high-quality, hands-on cybersecurity training more accessible and affordable, EC-Council empowers a broader, more diverse pool of individuals to enter and succeed in the cybersecurity field. This can help improve the overall cybersecurity landscape by equipping more professionals with the essential skills needed to protect against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.

3) **What actions should be taken:**
The information security steering committee should consider promoting these courses to county employees and integrating them into any existing employee development programs, especially for those in IT or security roles. Additionally, partnerships with local educational institutions could be explored to incorporate these courses into cybersecurity curricula, enhancing the overall skill level of the upcoming workforce. Regular reviews and potential sponsorships for talented but underprivileged individuals could further augment the county's cybersecurity posture.
