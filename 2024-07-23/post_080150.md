1) **What happened:** The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) released the fifth version of its Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK). This new version includes significant updates, covering modern cloud components, GenAI safety, Zero Trust security, and other advanced cloud security practices. It is designed to provide cloud security stakeholders with comprehensive knowledge required to protect critical assets in the cloud. The CCSK v5 offers multiple formats for training and a generative AI tool called CCSK Orb to help users master the material and address daily challenges.

2) **Why it matters:** Cloud computing is integral to contemporary business operations, with many organizations increasingly dependent on cloud services for their critical functions. As threats evolve, so do the complexities and risks associated with cloud security. The CSA's updated certification ensures that cybersecurity professionals are equipped with the latest and most comprehensive knowledge to secure cloud environments effectively. Mastery of these updated practices is crucial for organizations to protect sensitive data, maintain compliance, and mitigate the impact of potential breaches or cyberattacks.

3) **What actions should be taken:** The information security steering committee should encourage relevant staff to pursue the CCSK v5 certification to ensure the team is well-versed in current cloud security practices. Additionally, it benefits the county to integrate modern cloud security strategies highlighted in CCSK v5 into existing security protocols. Evaluation of the training formats available can help tailor the learning experience to the teamâ€™s needs, ensuring broad and deep understanding without disrupting daily operations. Finally, leveraging tools like the CCSK Orb can enhance ongoing education and practical application of cloud security principles in the department's daily activities.
