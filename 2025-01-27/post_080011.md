**1) What happened**

In early 2024, UnitedHealth’s subsidiary, Change Healthcare, suffered a significant ransomware attack by the BlackCat ransomware group, impacting 190 million Americans—doubling earlier reports. The attackers breached the system using stolen credentials that leveraged a lack of multi-factor authentication on the Citrix remote access service, stealing 6 TB of sensitive healthcare data. UnitedHealth paid the attackers a ransom both for a decryption tool and to prevent data leakage. Despite these payments, the attackers partnered with a new group, RansomHub, to leak data, demanding more money and causing extensive financial losses for UnitedHealth.

**2) Why it matters**

This breach represents the largest healthcare data breach in U.S. history, underlining vulnerabilities within critical healthcare IT infrastructures. The sheer volume of stolen data, including sensitive personal and health information, poses significant risks to individuals' privacy and may lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and compromised patient safety. It highlights the critical necessity of robust cybersecurity measures within the healthcare sector. Furthermore, the financial repercussions and operational disruptions underscore the urgent need for sectors handling sensitive information to prioritize cybersecurity to mitigate potential attacks and their profound impacts.

**3) What actions should be taken**

Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity measures by implementing multi-factor authentication, particularly for remote access services, to protect against unauthorized entry. Regular security audits and penetration testing can identify potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, they should ensure comprehensive employee training on cybersecurity practices and monitor systems for unusual activity to quickly identify breaches. Cooperative incident response frameworks should be established for timely mitigation and recovery actions. Building stronger public-private partnerships to improve threat intelligence sharing and considering cyber insurance for financial protection are also valuable strategies to manage and reduce the risks and impacts of cybersecurity incidents.
