1) The Romanian water management authority, Administrația Națională Apele Române, faced a ransomware attack impacting approximately 1,000 computer systems distributed across its national and regional offices. The attack leveraged the Windows BitLocker feature to lock files and demanded contact within seven days, although key water infrastructure remained unaffected. Romanian security agencies are investigating the incident. The attack's vector is yet unidentified, and no group has claimed responsibility; meanwhile, national protection systems are being integrated to prevent future incidents.

2) This incident matters as it highlights vulnerabilities in managing critical infrastructure, reflecting broader cybersecurity threats to essential services worldwide. Though operational systems remained unharmed, the attack signifies potential risks to water management, a crucial public service. The breach underscores the necessity of robust cybersecurity measures across all levels of critical infrastructure and warns of possible future cyber threats that could severely impact public safety, service continuity, and national security.

3) In response to such ransomware attacks, organizations should bolster their cybersecurity defenses, focusing on incident prevention and response strategies. Integration with national-level cyber defense systems, rigorous incident investigation, and improved security protocols, including enhanced endpoint security and employee security training, can reduce vulnerabilities. Establishing regular backups and contingency plans for critical systems ensures operational resilience. Additionally, international cooperation in monitoring threat actor activities would be beneficial for thorough threat attribution and prevention.
