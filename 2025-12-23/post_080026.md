Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-macsync-malware-dropper-evades-macos-gatekeeper-checks/

1) What happened:

The article discusses a new variant of the MacSync malware dropper that successfully evaded macOS Gatekeeper checks by employing a digitally signed, notarized Swift application. Distributed via a disk image named zk-call-messenger-installer-3.9.2-lts.dmg, the malware removes the need for terminal interaction, making it more sophisticated than previous versions. Despite having a valid signature from a Developer Team ID, the certificate has since been revoked by Apple after being reported. The dropper conceals itself using several evasion techniques before executing the information-stealing payload.

2) Why it matters:

This development is concerning as it demonstrates an advanced technique for bypassing built-in macOS security mechanisms, notably Gatekeeper, increasing the malware's potential impact. Such tactics highlight the evolving sophistication of macOS threats and their ability to surmount trusted security measures. The ability to steal sensitive data like iCloud credentials and cryptocurrency wallet information considerably raises the stakes, showcasing the need for continued vigilance and adaptation in macOS cybersecurity strategies, particularly as macOS continues to grow as a target for threat actors.

3) What actions should be taken:

Organizations should prioritize monitoring and updating their cybersecurity measures, particularly for macOS systems. Regularly updating to the latest security patches can mitigate newly discovered vulnerabilities. Implementing endpoint protection solutions that detect behaviors rather than signatures alone can help identify and block advanced threats. Employees must receive training on recognizing potential phishing attacks and unknown sources distributing seemingly legitimate applications. Engaging in prompt incident response and working with companies like Apple to report and address security certificates used maliciously can also aid in reducing the impacts of such sophisticated attacks.
