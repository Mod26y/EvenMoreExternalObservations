Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ivanti-warns-of-two-epmm-flaws-exploited-in-zero-day-attacks/

**1) What happened:** Ivanti disclosed two critical zero-day vulnerabilities, CVE-2026-1281 and CVE-2026-1340, in its Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) software. These are code-injection flaws enabling remote code execution without authentication, assigned a CVSS score of 9.8. Active exploitation has been minimal at disclosure time. Ivanti provided RPM scripts for temporary mitigation on specific EPMM versions, advising immediate implementation since exploitations employ in-house application distribution and Android file transfer features. These vulnerabilities expose administrative data and mobile device information and allow potential device configuration changes.

**2) Why it matters:** The flaws are critical due to their high exploitability and the sensitive information accessible within EPMM. Exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to a broad range of personal and organizational data, device tracking through GPS, and alterations to security settings. Given their zero-day status, organizations using EPMM face heightened risk without established detection or mitigation strategies. The inclusion of CVE-2026-1281 in the CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog underscores its active exploitation and potential for broader impact if not addressed promptly.

**3) What actions should be taken:** Organizations should promptly apply Ivanti's RPM scripts for immediate mitigation. After installing these patches, they should check web server access logs for signs of exploitation, using provided regular expressions to identify potential incidents. Firms suspecting compromised systems are advised against system cleaning, recommending restoration from uninfected backups instead. Passwords for EPMM accounts and associated services should be reset, and potentially compromised certificates revoked. Reviewing Sentry logs can help diagnose lateral network access, and monitoring CISA directives and updates on vulnerabilities will aid proactive security management.
