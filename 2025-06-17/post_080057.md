**What happened:** Zoomcar Holdings disclosed a cybersecurity incident on June 9, 2025, affecting 8.4 million users after unauthorized access to its system was detected. A threat actor informed Zoomcar employees about the breach, leading to the discovery. Compromised data includes customers' full names, phone numbers, car registration numbers, home addresses, and email addresses. The company has found no evidence of exposure of financial information or plaintext passwords. This marks the second major breach for Zoomcar, with a 2018 incident previously impacting millions of users.

**Why it matters:** This breach underscores the persistent vulnerability of large datasets, particularly those involving personal information, which remains a lucrative target for cybercriminals. Given Zoomcar's recent listing on Nasdaq, this breach has potential implications for its reputation and compliance with U.S. financial reporting standards. Moreover, exposure of such data, though not including financial details or plaintext passwords, can facilitate identity theft, phishing, and other forms of fraud, particularly in a company with a prior breach history.

**What actions should be taken:** Zoomcar should conduct a thorough investigation to determine the full extent of the breach and implement enhanced cybersecurity measures to prevent future incidents. They should notify affected users and provide guidance on steps to mitigate potential risks, such as monitoring for suspicious activity. Strengthening internal security protocols and employee training can also help reduce vulnerabilities. Additionally, Zoomcar should consider engaging third-party cybersecurity experts to audit their systems and recommend improvements. Regulatory compliance, particularly with the SEC, is essential, as is transparent communication with stakeholders.
