**1) What happened?**

SK Telecom experienced a significant cybersecurity breach that lasted almost three years, starting in June 2022 and detected in April 2025. The breach exposed sensitive data of approximately 27 million subscribers, including IMSI, USIM authentication keys, and network usage data, escalating the risk of SIM-swapping attacks. The breach affected about 23 servers with several types of malware, compromising customer data, and affecting normal network operations. The company responded by isolating affected systems and issuing SIM replacements to mitigate potential risks while also activating enhanced security measures.

**2) Why it matters?**

This breach is a profound example of the long-term impact undetected intrusions can have, especially in critical sectors like telecommunications. The exposure of data such as USIM authentication keys poses severe risks, including identity theft and fraudulent activities like SIM-swapping. For a major mobile network operator, this event highlights potential vulnerabilities in network defenses, emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring and incident response capabilities to address threats timely. Additionally, it serves as a warning for other similar organizations about the need for robust cybersecurity practices, given the extensive potential for data misuse and customer harm.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Organizations should conduct comprehensive security audits and continually monitor their systems for unusual activities, particularly in network sectors crucial to their business operations. They should also implement a robust incident response plan to identify, manage, and mitigate breaches swiftly. Encrypting sensitive data and frequently updating network security protocols can further reduce vulnerabilities. Customer education on recognizing and responding to fraudulent activities, such as SIM-swapping, can also be valuable. Furthermore, entities should collaborate with public and private sectors for threat intelligence sharing to enhance their overall cybersecurity posture.
