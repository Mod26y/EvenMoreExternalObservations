1. **What happened:**

Microsoft announced it will discontinue the Paint 3D graphics application later this year, removing it from the Microsoft Store by November 4, 2024. The 3D graphics program, initially launched eight years ago as part of Windows 10 Insider Build 14971, aimed to replace the classic Paint application. Users are advised to switch to the updated Paint and Photos apps for 2D image editing and the 3D Viewer for 3D content. Microsoft cited that existing installations would continue working, but new downloads would not be possible after the removal date.

2. **Why it matters:**

The discontinuation of Paint 3D signifies a shift in Microsoft's focus towards modernizing its core applications like Paint with enhanced features such as background removal, layers, image transparency, and AI-powered tools. This move reflects Microsoft's strategy to streamline its app offerings and concentrate on tools with broader user demand and support. IT departments need to be aware of these changes to manage software dependencies and user training, ensuring a smooth transition to alternative tools within their ecosystems.

3. **What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**

IT administrators should begin planning for the phase-out of Paint 3D by reviewing which users and workflows currently rely on the application. Communication should be sent to these users, informing them of the discontinuation and offering training resources for the alternative applicationsâ€”Paint, Photos, and 3D Viewer. Additionally, any software deployment and update mechanisms should be adjusted to prevent reliance on Paint 3D. Regularly revisiting and updating the software inventory might help in mitigating disruptions caused by such application deprecations in the future.
