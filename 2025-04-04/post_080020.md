1) A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability was identified in all versions of Apache Parquet up to version 1.15.0. This flaw arises from the deserialization of untrusted data, which malicious actors could exploit through specially crafted Parquet files to execute arbitrary code, steal or alter data, and potentially launch ransomware attacks. The issue is recorded as CVE-2025-30065 with a maximum CVSS score of 10.0. The vulnerability was rectified in version 1.15.1, making it crucial for systems using Parquet to upgrade to this version.

2) This vulnerability is significant due to the widespread adoption of Apache Parquet in big data environments, which includes major platforms and companies like Hadoop, AWS, and Netflix. Parquet is a go-to format for efficient data storage and analytics, making its security crucial. The flaw's potential to allow remote code execution means that attackers could severely disrupt services and compromise large datasets, causing significant operational and financial repercussions. With big data's central role in strategic decision-making, the vulnerability poses a substantial threat to organizations' data security and integrity.

3) Organizations utilizing Apache Parquet should prioritize upgrading to version 1.15.1 to safeguard against this vulnerability. In the interim, if immediate upgrading is not feasible, handling of Parquet files should be restricted to trusted sources, and their safety should be validated before processing. It is also advisable to enhance monitoring and logging for systems involved in Parquet processing to detect and respond to any suspicious activity swiftly. Organizations should conduct thorough checks with developers and vendors to assess their software stacks for potential exposure to impacted Parquet versions.
