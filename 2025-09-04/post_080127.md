1) The incident reported in the article highlights the issue of compromised routers remaining accessible on the internet for extended periods. These devices, once hacked, continue to pose a risk as they can be exploited repeatedly, allowing attackers to control network traffic, engage in data theft, and orchestrate larger cyber-attacks. The issue persists due to outdated firmware, lack of proper security configurations, and general user negligence, making these routers vulnerable long after the initial breach.

2) This situation is significant because routers are essential components of network infrastructure that ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data. When left compromised, they can serve as entry points for widespread cybercrime, affecting individuals and organizations alike. The damage from using compromised routers ranges from personal information theft to being part of botnets in coordinated cyber-attacks, posing substantial threats to personal privacy and national security.

3) Organizations and individuals should prioritize securing their networking devices by regularly updating firmware and applying security patches. Conducting routine audits and replacing older, unsupported routers can reduce vulnerabilities. Additionally, implementing strong access controls and network segmentation can help limit the extent of potential breaches. Awareness and training programs can further empower stakeholders to recognize and mitigate risks associated with maintaining obsolete or insecure network equipment.
