1) **What happened:** The U.S. Department of State announced a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the capture of three Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers who are allegedly responsible for cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure. These individuals are affiliated with military Unit 71330, known by various tracking names such as Berserk Bear and Dragonfly. They have been involved in exploiting vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2018-0171 in Cisco devices, to carry out cyber intrusions in critical sectors. This move follows previous charges against them for targeting U.S. and international energy companies.

2) **Why it matters:** This bounty underscores the increasing cybersecurity threats posed by state-sponsored actors and highlights the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to sophisticated cyberattacks. The activities of these FSB officers illustrate how advanced persistent threats (APTs) operate and the extensive reach they have in compromising high-value targets globally. Addressing these threats is crucial for national security, as cyberattacks can disrupt critical services and lead to significant infrastructural damage and data breaches with far-reaching implications.

3) **What actions should be taken:** Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity measures by promptly patching known vulnerabilities like CVE-2018-0171 and employing robust security practices to defend against APTs. Regular security audits and threat intelligence sharing can help identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Additionally, organizations should consider contacting channels like Rewards for Justice for any information on suspicious activities related to state-sponsored threats. Collaboration between government and private sectors, as well as international partnerships, is essential to effectively counteract these state-sponsored cyber threats.
