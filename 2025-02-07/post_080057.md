The article details two critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-20124 and CVE-2025-20125, found in Cisco's Identity Services Engine (ISE). These flaws allow authenticated remote attackers, with even minimal admin rights, to execute commands as root and bypass authorization. The issue, with one vulnerability rated at 9.9/10 in severity, stems from insecure deserialization and inadequate input validation. All configurations of Cisco ISE and ISE Passive Identity Connector devices are vulnerable until patched. Importantly, there are no known public exploits yet, but the potential risk indicates an urgent need for action.

This situation matters greatly due to the ubiquity of Cisco ISE as a critical access management tool in enterprises. Unpatched vulnerabilities could allow attackers to gain unauthorized control, compromise sensitive data, and disrupt operations. Given the high severity, organizations utilizing these platforms face increased risks that could impact confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and services. The vulnerabilities' potential to be exploited remotely amplifies the threat, urging prompt attention from any organization relying on Cisco ISE for security policy management.

As a precautionary measure, updating systems to the fixed releases is recommended. System administrators should prioritize migrating or upgrading to the secure versions listed by Cisco. Additionally, monitoring for unusual activity or emerging threats should be intensified. It's also beneficial to review overall system security and ensure all potential attack vectors are fortified, potentially deploying extra monitoring for anomalous behaviors. Lastly, staff should remain informed on security bulletins from Cisco and other vendors to respond quickly to new issues.
