1) The article's title suggests attackers are enhancing their spam campaigns with a new tactic called "Salt." While specific details of the content are inaccessible, it can be inferred that "Salting" involves adding complexity or custom data to spam campaigns to bypass detection mechanisms. This could mean incorporating unique elements into spam content to evade standard filtering systems that typically detect mass-produced, repetitive spam signatures.

2) This development matters because it indicates an evolution in spam tactics, increasing the threat level since these messages can potentially reach more users. Enhanced spam campaigns can lead to higher incidences of phishing and malware distribution, compromising sensitive information and financial assets. Understanding this shift helps organizations remain vigilant and proactive in combating potentially more sophisticated and damaging attacks.

3) Organizations should consider reviewing and updating their email filtering protocols to be more adaptive against novel tactics like "Salting" in spam. It would be prudent to educate staff about recognizing more believable and harder-to-detect phishing attempts. Regularly updating security awareness training and enhancing threat detection capabilities with more sophisticated, AI-driven tools could better equip organizations to manage these evolving threats effectively.
