1) The article likely discusses a reactivation of an Iranian Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group that was previously considered dormant. This group is engaged in cyber espionage activities targeting dissidents. APTs often use sophisticated techniques to gather intelligence over long periods. Their resurgence indicates ongoing operations to monitor, manipulate, or disrupt individuals or organizations perceived as threats to the Iranian regime.

2) This development is significant as it highlights a persistent threat to cybersecurity, particularly for groups targeted for their political beliefs or activism. The continuation of these activities underscores the need for vigilance and adaptation in defensive strategies, as APTs often evolve their tactics over time. For targeted individuals and organizations, this situation poses a direct threat to privacy and operational security.

3) Organizations and individuals who might be targets should enhance their cybersecurity measures. This includes updating threat intelligence protocols to identify new tactics employed by the APT, conducting regular security audits, and ensuring all software and systems are up-to-date with the latest patches. Additionally, educating staff and stakeholders on recognizing phishing attempts and practicing good cyber hygiene can help mitigate the risk of infiltration.
