The article reports an automated password spraying campaign targeting VPN platforms from Palo Alto Networks and Cisco. GreyNoise observed up to 1.7 million login attempts against GlobalProtect portals within 16 hours, originating from over 10,000 unique IPs, mainly from a German IP space provider. These attacks involve reusing common username-password combinations, suggesting a scripted approach rather than exploiting vulnerabilities. By December 12, similar probes targeted Cisco SSL VPNs, marking a significant uptick in attack activity using the same provider infrastructure.

This event highlights a persistent threat to enterprise VPN endpoints, even without exploiting specific software vulnerabilities. The reliance on end-user credentials means attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access if weak passwords are used or MFA is absent. This activity underscores the importance of strengthening VPN authentication methods to defend against increasingly sophisticated automated attacks that exploit credential weaknesses.

Organizations should enhance protective measures by enforcing strong passwords, implementing multi-factor authentication, and monitoring VPN access logs for unusual activities. Regular audits of network appliances can help identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, blocking known malicious IP addresses identified during these campaigns can mitigate ongoing risks, reducing exposure to unauthorized access efforts.
