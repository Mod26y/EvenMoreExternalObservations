**1) What happened:**

A critical vulnerability in the Samlify library, tracked as CVE-2025-47949, allows attackers to impersonate admin users by injecting unsigned malicious assertions into SAML responses. This flaw, known as a Signature Wrapping flaw, impacts all Samlify versions before 2.10.0. Despite appropriately verifying signed XML documents, the library's parsing logic inadvertently processes malicious assertions inserted into the document. This vulnerability enables a complete SSO bypass, allowing attackers to perform privilege escalation and access systems as administrators without requiring any user interaction or special privileges.

**2) Why it matters:**

This vulnerability is significant due to its potential to compromise single sign-on (SSO) systems used by many organizations, affecting users across various platforms, including SaaS services and corporate identity management systems. Given its critical severity (CVSS score: 9.9), organizations relying on Samlify risk unauthorized access and privilege escalation attacks, leading to potential data breaches and unauthorized control over systems. The simplicity of exploitation, due to the requirement of only a valid signed XML blob, elevates the threat level, necessitating urgent remedial measures to protect sensitive information and maintain organizational security.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations using Samlify should prioritize updating to version 2.10.0 to mitigate this vulnerability. It is essential to confirm the updated version is downloaded from npm to ensure the patched version is installed. Additionally, reviewing and auditing SAML response handling within applications can help identify potential weaknesses. Implementing better monitoring for unusual authentication activities, ensuring the security of SAML communications, and enhancing privilege management systems can further protect against exploitation. Regular cybersecurity training for developers can also aid in understanding and securing SAML implementations against similar vulnerabilities.
