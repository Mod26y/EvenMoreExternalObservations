However, the focus on "Agentic AI" suggests that the article discusses how artificial intelligence with agency – autonomous decision-making capabilities – can enhance cyber defense strategies.

2) The concept of Agentic AI in cybersecurity is significant as it implies systems that can adapt and respond to threats autonomously, which is crucial in an era of rapidly evolving cyber threats. These AI systems can identify and neutralize threats faster than traditional human-driven processes, improving the overall resiliency of IT infrastructures. Understanding advanced AI applications in cybersecurity helps organizations prepare and adapt their defense strategies to modern threats, thus safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining operational integrity.

3) In light of this topic, organizations may consider evaluating their current cybersecurity frameworks to explore the integration of AI technologies that possess autonomous capabilities. It would be beneficial for the information security steering committee to investigate and possibly pilot such AI solutions. This proactive approach would involve training staff on AI systems management while ensuring these technologies align with data privacy regulations and ethical standards. Additionally, continuous monitoring and assessment should be established to measure the effectiveness and adjust to any new security challenges.
