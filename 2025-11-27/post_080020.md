It's advisable to evaluate which plan best suits their needs, considering factors such as additional security features and budget constraints. Additionally, enterprises should educate employees about the importance of using VPNs during high-risk periods to prevent data leaks and unauthorized network access. Finally, continuous monitoring for cybersecurity threats during the holiday season is crucial to maintain organizational security integrity.
