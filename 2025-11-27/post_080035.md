In February 2024, a data breach at Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a former debt collector for Comcast, exposed the personal data of nearly 275,000 Comcast customers. Despite Comcast having severed ties with FBCS two years prior, the breach compromised sensitive information like Social Security numbers and Comcast account numbers. The breach initially appeared to affect 1.9 million individuals, increasing to 4.2 million by July. FBCS, which had declared bankruptcy, delayed informing Comcast until months after the attack, having previously assured Comcast that its customers were not affected.

This data breach is significant because it highlights the risks associated with third-party vendors handling sensitive customer information, even after contractual relationships end. It underscores the critical need for ongoing oversight and compliance, particularly for large companies like Comcast with extensive customer bases. The situation also brings attention to Comcast's legal and reputation management challenges and emphasizes the importance of timely incident reporting by vendors.

In response, organizations should revisit and strengthen their vendor management and data disposal processes to prevent similar incidents. Active monitoring and regular risk assessments of third-party vendors are crucial for early breach detection. Clear contractual obligations related to data security should remain enforceable even after service termination. Moreover, implementing timely incident reporting mechanisms and a structured response plan ensures swift corrective actions and stakeholder communication.
