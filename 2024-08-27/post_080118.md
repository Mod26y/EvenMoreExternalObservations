**1) What happened?**

On August 24, the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and the Port of Seattle experienced system outages impacting internet, websites, email, phone services, and baggage sorting systems, potentially due to a cyberattack. While security operations remained intact, the affected amenities prompted the Port of Seattle to isolate critical systems and work towards restoring full service. The disruptions continued into the following day, and travelers were advised to check in online and use mobile boarding passes.

This incident underscores the vulnerabilities of critical infrastructure to cyber threats, highlighting potential risks to operational continuity and public services. Airports are central to transportation and economic activities, and disruptions can impact not just local but also global commerce and security. Effective cybersecurity measures and crisis management plans are essential to maintain service integrity and trust. Moreover, the possibility of interconnected systems being exploited can lead to widespread repercussions beyond initial targets.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Given this incident, organizations, especially those managing critical infrastructure, should review and enhance their cybersecurity frameworks and incident response plans. Conducting thorough audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, enhancing monitoring and detection systems, and ensuring robust backup and disaster recovery processes would be prudent. Additionally, staff should undergo regular cybersecurity training to recognize and respond to threats effectively. Collaboration with federal agencies and the cybersecurity community to share intelligence and best practices could further fortify defenses against evolving cyber threats.
