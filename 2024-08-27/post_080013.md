### 1) What Happened

Patelco Credit Union experienced a significant data breach due to a ransomware attack by the RansomHub gang, which accessed their network on May 23, 2024, and extracted customer data by June 29, 2024. Following this breach, the attackers published the stolen data on their extortion portal on August 15, 2024, after failed negotiations with Patelco. The breach affected 726,000 customers and resulted in the exposure of sensitive personal information including full names, Social Security numbers (SSNs), driver's license numbers, dates of birth, and email addresses.

### 2) Why It Matters

This data breach is critical due to the extensive scale and sensitivity of the compromised information, which includes SSNs and driver’s license numbers that can be exploited for identity theft and other fraudulent activities. It affects the trust and financial security of Patelco’s large customer base. Additionally, the attack disrupted key customer-facing banking systems for two weeks, highlighting vulnerabilities in Patelco's cybersecurity measures. The disclosure underscores the rising threats from ransomware and the importance of robust incident response strategies in financial institutions.

### 3) What Actions Should Be Taken

In response to the breach, several measures should be considered to mitigate impact and prevent future incidents. Customers should be advised to enroll in the offered identity protection and credit monitoring services promptly. Patelco could enhance its cybersecurity infrastructure by implementing advanced threat detection, regular security audits, and improved disaster recovery plans. Additionally, regular customer education on recognizing phishing and social engineering tactics is crucial to reduce the risk of related scams. Finally, Patelco should collaborate with law enforcement and cybersecurity experts to trace the attack's origins and potentially recover compromised data.
