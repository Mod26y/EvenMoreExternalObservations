Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ssl-tls-certificate-lifespans-reduced-to-47-days-by-2029/

1) What happened:
The CA/Browser Forum, which includes major certificate authorities and browser vendors, voted to reduce the lifespan of SSL/TLS certificates from 398 days to just 47 days by March 2029. This change will occur incrementally, with lifespans decreasing to 200 days by 2026 and 100 days by 2027. The initiative aims to address risks from outdated certificates and deprecated algorithms, while encouraging automation in certificate renewal processes.

2) Why it matters:
This change is significant because shorter certificate lifespans reduce the risks of compromised and outdated certificates, enhancing overall internet security. It will also spur the adoption of automated certificate management practices, which can lead to more agile and secure systems. However, businesses managing multiple domains will face increased administrative burdens, particularly those not yet utilizing automated processes. Failing to adapt could lead to increased exposure to security incidents, as well as potential disruptions due to expired certificates.

3) What actions should be taken:
Organizations should begin transitioning to automated certificate management systems, such as those supporting the ACME protocol, to handle shorter certificate lifecycles efficiently. It is prudent for IT and security teams to evaluate current infrastructure and adopt tools that support continual certificate monitoring and renewal. Stakeholders should also educate themselves on upcoming changes to ensure compliance and minimize service disruptions. Additionally, reviewing and adjusting certificate management policies and procedures will prepare organizations for a seamless transition to the new standards set by the CA/Browser Forum.
