**1) What happened:**
Hertz Corporation confirmed a data breach involving unauthorized access to customer information from its Hertz, Thrifty, and Dollar brands due to exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Cleo's platform. This breach resulted in the theft of sensitive customer data, including names, contact details, credit card information, driver's licenses, and possibly Social Security numbers. Despite no confirmed misuse, the Clop ransomware gang, known for similar attacks, leaked this data on their site. The breach initially affected several companies, including Hertz, as a part of a larger attack on Cleo managed file transfer platforms.

**2) Why it matters:**
This data breach is significant as it highlights the vulnerabilities in widely-used third-party software platforms like Cleo, which, once compromised, can lead to breaches affecting multiple companies. The incident underscores the critical need for robust vulnerability management practices, including timely identification and patching of zero-day vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the theft and potential misuse of sensitive personal information could lead to identity theft and financial fraud, impacting thousands of individuals and damaging the affected companies' reputations and customer trust.

**3) Actions to be taken:**
Organizations should prioritize assessing and enhancing their third-party risk management practices, focusing on identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in third-party software systems. Implementing rigorous patch management and conducting regular security audits can mitigate the risk of similar breaches. Additionally, companies should develop comprehensive incident response plans to swiftly address data breaches and communicate transparently with affected individuals. Offering services like identity monitoring to affected customers, as Hertz has done, can help mitigate potential impacts on personally impacted individuals. Collaboration with cybersecurity agencies and sharing threat intelligence with industry peers may prevent future incidents.
