1) What happened:
Hackers are exploiting a critical vulnerability in the "Hunk Companion" WordPress plugin to install other plugins with known exploitable flaws. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute remote code, conduct SQL injections, and perform cross-site scripting attacks. WPScan discovered the flaw, identified as CVE-2024-11972, and its exploitation to activate plugins like the outdated WP Query Console for malicious purposes. Although Hunk Companion version 1.9.0 addresses this flaw, many users have not updated, leaving numerous sites vulnerable.

2) Why it matters:
This situation highlights the risks introduced by third-party plugins with security vulnerabilities, particularly when widely used for website customization. Exploitation can compromise site integrity, leading to unauthorized access and potentially severe impacts such as data breaches or site takeovers. Sites running vulnerable plugins can serve as entry points for broader network compromises, escalating the risk for organizations relying on the affected installations. The prominence of WordPress further magnifies the potential scale of impact across different sectors.

3) What actions should be taken:
Site administrators using Hunk Companion should promptly update to version 1.9.0 to mitigate the threat. Regular audits of installed plugins should be conducted to ensure they are up-to-date and secure. Implementing a robust patch management strategy and monitoring for unusual site activity can help identify potential compromises earlier. Additionally, organizations may benefit from educating website teams about the importance of maintaining plugin hygiene and utilizing security plugins capable of alerting to unauthorized changes or vulnerable components.
