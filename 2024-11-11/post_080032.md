Hackers have innovated new methods to evade detection by utilizing ZIP file concatenation to deliver malware payloads. The technique involves merging multiple ZIP archives into one, making it difficult for standard security tools to detect malicious content. This method was identified by Perception Point during an analysis of a phishing attack involving fake shipping notices, where malware was concealed in a concatenated archive disguised as a RAR archive. This method exploits the differing ways ZIP parsers interpret concatenated files, leading to potential oversight by certain applications.

This development in cyberattack methodology is significant because it highlights a gap in traditional antivirus and cybersecurity solutions that may fail to detect threatening content within concatenated ZIP files. By exploiting inconsistencies in file handling by different ZIP parsing applications, attackers can effectively obscure malicious payloads, increasing the success rate of their campaigns. This method specifically targets Windows platforms, which are widely used, thereby presenting substantial risks to individuals and organizations.

Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity strategies by implementing solutions capable of recursive unpacking, allowing for the analysis of each component within concatenated ZIP files. Increased awareness and training about suspicious emails, especially those with ZIP or similar compressed file attachments, can help mitigate the risk of such attacks. Security policies should be updated to include filtering mechanisms that manage and restrict attachments with risky file extensions, and periodic reviews of security solution settings might further fortify defenses against these advanced evasion techniques.
