1) The reported issue involves macOS applications freezing when users attempt to open or save files in OneDrive folders such as Desktop and Documents. This glitch specifically affects systems running the latest macOS release, known as Sequoia. Users facing this problem are advised to force quit a specific process and use alternative file storage locations until Microsoft develops a more permanent solution. This disruption in functionality is a recognized problem, and Microsoft is currently working to investigate and resolve it.

2) This issue is significant because it impacts productivity and user experience, especially given the reliance many users have on cloud storage solutions like OneDrive for seamless access to files across devices. Such hindrances could disrupt workflows and create data accessibility challenges for macOS users reliant on Microsoft services. Additionally, it underscores the critical nature of compatibility and integration in software updates across different platforms, serving as a reminder for organizations to remain vigilant about potential risks from software updates.

3) In response to this information, affected users should adopt the workarounds provided by Microsoft to minimize disruption. Organizations with users who rely heavily on OneDrive for file storage should communicate these workarounds internally and provide support as needed. Additionally, it's prudent to monitor for updates from both Microsoft and Apple regarding compatibility issues and advisories. For cybersecurity assurance, reassess cloud storage contingency plans to ensure that data remains accessible even when such disruptions occur, including evaluating alternative storage solutions and backup systems.
