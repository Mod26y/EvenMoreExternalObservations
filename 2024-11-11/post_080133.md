**What happened:** The article discusses the challenges and misconceptions in integrating security into software development processes, highlighting the tensions typically found between developers and security professionals. Developers often focus on rapid feature deployment, while security professionals emphasize risk mitigation, leading to potential conflicts. The article argues for the DevSecOps approach, which seeks to embed security within the development lifecycle to streamline secure feature releases effectively. This methodology stresses the importance of understanding risk portfolios, automating security testing, and simplifying the developer's experience to foster a balanced collaboration that includes continuous monitoring.

**Why it matters:** With an increasing dependency on software technologies, evolving efficient and secure development practices has become crucial for organizations. The DevSecOps approach addresses the friction between speed and security by ensuring security is a continuous, integrated process rather than a subsequent concern. By embracing DevSecOps, organizations can effectively manage their security risks, reduce the likelihood of vulnerabilities, and maintain a competitive advantage through the rapid yet secure deployment of features. This balance is vital for protecting sensitive information, maintaining trust with users, and ensuring compliance with cybersecurity standards.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations could start by conducting a comprehensive risk assessment of their software resources, including third-party and open-source dependencies, to understand their security posture better. Automating security processes within the development pipeline can significantly minimize manual intervention and expedite the detection of vulnerabilities. Simplifying the security task for developers through familiarity with their working environments could enhance the adoption of secure practices. Continuous monitoring should be implemented to ensure security checks are ongoing and proactive. By nurturing a culture that values collaboration between security and development teams, organizations can achieve a practical DevSecOps implementation.
