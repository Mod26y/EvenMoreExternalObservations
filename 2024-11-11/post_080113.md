The article outlines six unpatched vulnerabilities in Mazda's in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) system that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access through a USB, posing risks to vehicle safety. The vulnerabilities permit full system compromise, data access, and possible intrusion into the car's Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, affecting components like the engine and airbags. Although they require physical USB insertion, the potential for remote exploits in the future raises concerns for broader implications on connected vehicles.

These vulnerabilities highlight the growing cybersecurity risks in modern vehicles, transforming them into potential targets for cyberattacks. Given the evolving nature of car connectivity, as seen in recent wireless exploits, these vulnerabilities stress the need for robust security measures in automotive design. Enhanced security can prevent unauthorized manipulation of critical vehicle systems, ensuring driver and passenger safety.

To address the concerns raised, automotive manufacturers should prioritize patching existing vulnerabilities in their infotainment systems. Implementing a multilayered security architecture that assumes potential compromise can strengthen the resilience of car systems. Regular security audits, thorough input validation, and robust authentication protocols are recommended strategies to safeguard vehicle networks against future vulnerabilities and potential attacks.
