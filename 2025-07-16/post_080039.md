1) What happened: An emergency update, KB5064489, was released by Microsoft to address a bug that prevented Azure virtual machines (VMs) from launching. This issue occurred when the Trusted Launch setting was disabled, and Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) was enabled, affecting Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11 24H2 versions following the July Patch Tuesday updates. This problem stemmed from a secure kernel initialization issue affecting non-Trusted Launch General Enterprise VMs on older Azure VM SKUs.

2) Why it matters: This issue is critical as it hinders organizations relying on Azure VMs for their IT infrastructure, potentially disrupting business operations. The secure kernel initialization issue compromised the ability to launch and operate essential virtual machines safely, impacting the continuity and reliability of services. Ensuring VMs run smoothly underpins business resilience and security, highlighting the need for rapid issue identification and resolution.

3) What actions should be taken: Organizations utilizing Azure VMs, particularly those running Windows Server 2025 and Windows 11 24H2, should assess their systems to determine if they are affected by this bug. Administrators should verify if VBS is enabled and Trusted Launch is disabled. Impacted setups should promptly apply the KB5064489 update to resolve the issue. Additionally, employing the Trusted Launch security feature can preemptively safeguard against similar disruptions. Regularly updating and patching systems remains crucial to maintain robust cybersecurity defenses.
