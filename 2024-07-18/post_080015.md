### 1) What Happened
Microsoft has initiated the public preview of Inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC for Exchange Online. This enhancement integrates DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) with Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) to improve email security. DANE verifies the identity of mail servers and prevents TLS-downgrade and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, while DNSSEC ensures the cryptographic integrity of DNS records, preventing spoofing and hijacking. This advancement is part of a phased rollout, with general availability expected by late 2024, aimed at enhancing the security of email communication across all Outlook domains.

### 2) Why It Matters
This development significantly enhances the security of email communications, a common vector for cyberattacks. By preventing TLS-downgrade and MiTM attacks, as well as safeguarding against DNS spoofing and hijacking, Microsoft is bolstering the integrity and confidentiality of email data. For a large US County, adopting these standards can reduce vulnerability to phishing, data breaches, and impersonation attacks, safeguarding sensitive information. This enhanced security protocol aligns with broader cybersecurity trends and compliance requirements, fostering trust and reliability in digital communications.

### 3) What Actions Should Be Taken
The County's information security steering committee should consider the adoption of these new security features once available. Initiating a review of the current email security infrastructure to identify integration opportunities with SMTP DANE and DNSSEC is advisable. Collaboration with IT staff to update the email security policies and awareness programs, emphasizing the importance of these new standards, could be beneficial. Additionally, conducting a pilot implementation within a controlled group before full-scale deployment can help in resolving potential issues and ensuring seamless transition and maximum security benefits.
