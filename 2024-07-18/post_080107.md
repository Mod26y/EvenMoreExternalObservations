1) **What Happened:**
Threat actors have increased their use of encoded URLs to bypass secure email gateways (SEGs), effectively sending phishing and malware-laden emails past defenses. Security researchers at Cofense detected a rise in this tactic, noting that some SEGs improperly handle encoded URLs by assuming they are safe. As a result, emails with malicious URLs encoded by other SEGs frequently pass through without proper vetting, increasing the potential for successful cyber attacks.

2) **Why It Matters:**
This development is significant because it exploits a critical vulnerability in the defensive mechanisms that many organizations rely on to protect against email-based threats. As SEGs are widely used to prevent phishing and malware attacks, the inability of these tools to adequately scan and detect malicious URLs within encoded links represents a substantial security risk. If unaddressed, this gap could lead to successful cyber intrusions, data breaches, and financial losses for organizations.

3) **Actions to Be Taken:**
Organizations should enhance employee training to increase vigilance against suspicious emails, with an emphasis on encoded URLs. It may also be helpful to collaborate with SEG vendors to push for updates and improved scanning capabilities that can better recognize and vet encoded URLs. Additionally, implementing multi-layered security protocols, including endpoint security solutions and robust email filtering systems, can provide another line of defense should a SEG fail to detect a malicious link.
