1) **What Happened:**
Infostealer malware developers have released updates that can bypass Google Chrome’s recent security enhancement called App-Bound Encryption, designed to protect sensitive data like cookies and stored passwords. Despite this encryption, researchers have confirmed that various infostealers, including Lumma Stealer, MeduzaStealer, and Whitesnake, have implemented methods to steal cookies even within the latest Chrome versions. These updates allow the malware to function without needing system privileges or admin rights, thus avoiding detection more easily by security tools.

2) **Why It Matters:**
This development is significant because it undercuts a critical security feature intended to protect users' sensitive information from theft. If infostealer malware can bypass Chrome’s encryption, it poses a substantial risk to both individual user data and organizational information security. Cookies and stored passwords can allow attackers unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to credential theft, identity fraud, and further dissemination of malicious activities within compromised systems.

3) **What Actions Should Be Taken:**
Organizations should reinforce endpoint security measures, focusing on both user education and technical controls. Employees should be made aware of the risks associated with malware and the importance of cautious browsing and downloading habits. On the technical side, multi-layered defenses should be deployed, including up-to-date anti-malware solutions and behavioral analytics to detect anomalies. IT departments might also benefit from regularly reviewing and updating security policies, implementing network segmentation, and utilizing least privilege access models to minimize the potential damage from such threats. Additionally, engaging in ongoing monitoring and threat intelligence activities can help preemptively identify and mitigate new threats.
