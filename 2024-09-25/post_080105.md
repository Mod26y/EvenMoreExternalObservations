### What Happened

The article addresses multiple critical security vulnerabilities discovered in automatic tank gauge (ATG) systems used to monitor and manage fuel storage tanks in various critical infrastructure facilities. Researchers reported that these vulnerabilities, some unpatched, could allow attackers to gain full control of the ATG systems. Despite efforts by Bitsight, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and affected vendors to mitigate these issues, several ATGs remain unpatched and exposed to the internet, making them susceptible to cyberattacks. Some vendors have released patches, but others have not engaged in remediation efforts.

### Why It Matters

This issue is significant because ATGs are crucial in managing fuel levels and detecting leaks in critical facilities, including gas stations, airports, hospitals, and military installations. The ability for attackers to control these systems could lead to substantial physical and environmental damage, including undetected fuel overflows or disruptions in fuel availability. Additionally, these vulnerabilities highlight the broader issue of critical infrastructure systems being exposed to the internet without adequate security measures, making them prime targets for cyberattacks from both rogue actors and nation-state adversaries.

### Actions To Be Taken

Given the identified vulnerabilities and ongoing risks, organizations using ATG systems should consider taking several steps. First, disconnecting these devices from public internet access can mitigate the immediate threat. Patching vulnerable systems where updates are available is also essential. For vendors that have not responded or provided patches, alternative mitigations such as network segmentation or enhanced monitoring should be considered. Additionally, a broader review of exposure and risk assessments for all critical infrastructure systems should be undertaken. Security practices that anticipate and mitigate vulnerabilities must be prioritized to protect these essential operational technologies from threats.
