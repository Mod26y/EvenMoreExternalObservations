### What Happened
The article discusses the cybersecurity challenges faced by sports organizations, focusing on vulnerabilities in event operations, athlete interactions with fans, data protection, and partnerships with legal gambling and streaming services. Adversaries have targeted sports events to disrupt activities, commit fraud, steal sensitive data, and manipulate information. Key incidents include nation-state influence campaigns during the Paris 2024 Olympics and concerns about data theft in sports gambling.

### Why It Matters
The increasing digitization in sports operations, from e-tickets to streaming and gambling data, has expanded attack surfaces, making events and stakeholders more vulnerable to cyber threats. This is significant because any disruption, such as tampering with broadcast signals or stealing proprietary data, can have broad financial, reputational, and operational repercussions. The interdependence of various partners and stakeholders heightens the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data and ensure the safety of athletes and spectators.

### Actions to Take
Organizations should enhance cybersecurity awareness and training, particularly for athletes who frequently use social media platforms. Event organizers can work with public and private sector partners to bolster incident response plans and information-sharing protocols. Additionally, integrating advanced data protection measures, especially around streaming services and sports gambling, can mitigate risks. Conducting regular security audits and adopting a layered security approach can further protect critical infrastructure and sensitive information from cyber threats.
