The Chinese-linked hacking group 'FamousSparrow' has been identified using an improved version of their backdoor malware, 'SparrowDoor,' in attacks against a US-based trade organization, as well as entities in Mexico and Honduras. Researchers at ESET observed these attacks, noting the groupâ€™s increased activity since their last exposure in 2022. The initial access was gained through vulnerabilities in outdated Microsoft Exchange and Windows Server endpoints, allowing the deployment of webshells. The new SparrowDoor version features enhanced code quality, parallel command execution, and a modular structure for loading plugins at runtime, making it more evasive and potent.

This situation is critical as it highlights the ongoing risk posed by sophisticated cyberespionage threats linked to state-sponsored actors. The use of upgraded and modular malware increases the attack surface and potential damage, particularly when combined with vulnerabilities in widely used software like Microsoft Exchange. The integration of high-tier tools such as ShadowPad further underscores the capability and resource access of these groups, suggesting a concerted effort to infiltrate and manipulate vital systems across various sectors, potentially compromising sensitive information with far-reaching implications.

Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity posture by promptly patching known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange and Windows Server systems to thwart initial entry points. Continuous monitoring for abnormal activities, particularly those associated with modular backdoors, is crucial. Furthermore, implementing advanced threat detection mechanisms and strengthening defenses against DLL side-loading would help mitigate risks posed by advanced persistent threats (APTs) like FamousSparrow. Employing threat intelligence sharing and collaboration can also offer broader insight into emerging tactics and tools used by these groups.
