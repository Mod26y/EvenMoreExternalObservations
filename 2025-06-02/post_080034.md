In the article, two critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-48827 and CVE-2025-48828, affecting vBulletin forum software, have been identified. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute remote code unauthenticated, leveraging misuses of PHP's Reflection API and template engine flaws, particularly in vBulletin versions utilizing PHP 8.1 or later. Although these issues have likely been patched with subsequent updates, unpatched sites still exist, putting them at risk. Hackers are already exploiting CVE-2025-48827, with attempts observed to deploy PHP backdoors, indicating a high likelihood of eventual full RCE exploitation.

This revelation is significant because vBulletin is extensively used worldwide, hosting numerous online communities. As a result, the exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to large-scale data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential data theft from millions of users globally. The widespread use of vBulletin means that many websites may remain unprotected if administrators have failed to apply the necessary security patches, leaving a broad attack surface for malicious actors.

To mitigate these risks, forum administrators should promptly update vBulletin installations to the latest version, 6.1.1, which is reportedly unaffected by these vulnerabilities. IT teams need to prioritize the application of security patches and consider automated patch management solutions to streamline the updating process, reduce the window of exposure, and enhance overall security posture. Additionally, monitoring network traffic and logs for exploitation attempts can help detect and respond swiftly to any unauthorized intrusions leveraging these vulnerabilities.
