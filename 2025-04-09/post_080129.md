**What Happened:** Unfortunately, I am unable to access the specific content of the article due to a 403 Forbidden error, indicating access is restricted. However, the headline suggests it discusses the security challenges that arise when software development becomes democratized. Democratized development typically refers to a model where non-traditional or citizen developers, equipped with low-code or no-code platforms, engage in creating and deploying applications. While this approach accelerates innovation and allows more individuals to contribute, it potentially expands the attack surface and introduces risks due to varying levels of expertise in adhering to secure coding practices.

**Why It Matters:** The democratization of development matters because it represents a shift in how software is created, making it accessible to individuals without formal coding backgrounds. This can lead to more innovation and rapid prototyping but also poses a significant security risk. Non-expert developers might overlook essential security measures or fail to recognize vulnerabilities. This can result in applications being more susceptible to attacks, potentially exposing sensitive data, disrupting services, and increasing the likelihood of security breaches that could affect broader organizational IT infrastructures and their users.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:** Organizations should prioritize implementing robust security frameworks that include guidelines, training, and tools focused on secure coding practices for all developers, regardless of their experience level. It is crucial to leverage automated security testing solutions that integrate with development platforms used by non-traditional developers. Establishing clear policies on application deployment and regular security audits can help in identifying and mitigating risks early. Encouraging collaboration between IT security teams and democratized development initiatives can ensure a more secure development environment, reducing vulnerabilities and safeguarding systems from potential threats.
