Without access to the specific details of the article, let's focus on the general context based on the title and typical issues within the realm of application security.
 
1. **What happened:** Organizations are reportedly addressing less than half of all exploitable vulnerabilities, with a particularly low fix rate of 21% for vulnerabilities associated with generative AI applications. This indicates a significant gap in vulnerability management, especially as new technologies like GenAI become more prevalent in operational applications.

2. **Why it matters:** Unfixed vulnerabilities leave organizations exposed to potential breaches, data losses, and other cyber threats. The low resolution rate for GenAI-related vulnerabilities underscores the challenges posed by emerging technologies, which could lead to increased security incidents if not properly managed. This issue highlights the necessity for improved vulnerability management processes and the need to focus on the security implications of new technologies.

3. **What actions should be taken:** Organizations should enhance their vulnerability management programs by prioritizing the identification and remediation of vulnerabilities, especially those in emerging technologies. Regular security assessments, coupled with robust patch management practices, can help address the backlog of exploitable vulnerabilities. Investing in tools and talent that specialize in securing new technologies like GenAI will be crucial for reducing associated risks and ensuring broader security posture improvements.
