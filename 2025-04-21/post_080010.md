The recent rollout of a new Microsoft Entra security feature, MACE Credential Revocation, has unintentionally triggered widespread account lockouts due to false positives. This new feature is designed to detect leaked credentials and automatically lock potentially compromised accounts, but has mistakenly flagged many accounts as compromised despite their credentials remaining secure. The issue has affected numerous organizations, with reports of account lockouts and multiple alerts citing leaked credentials, which were unsupported by other breach detection services. Microsoft is investigating, and initial advisories suggest erroneous alerts related to Tenant Lockout and Error Code 53003.

This issue is significant because it demonstrates potential pitfalls in implementing automated security features without adequate testing, which can disrupt business operations and erode trust in security solutions. Accounts being incorrectly locked could impede productivity, strain IT resources, and cause unnecessary security-related stress among users and administrators. The situation highlights the necessity of balancing security enhancements with reliability, to avoid inadvertently creating vulnerabilities or operational hurdles through false positives.

Organizations should closely monitor communications from Microsoft for updates regarding this issue and verify any alerts of leaked credentials through multiple sources before reacting. It's prudent to review and possibly adjust access and conditional policies, ensuring they allow for rapid recovery in case of erroneous lockouts. Additionally, administrators might temporarily disable or modify new features like MACE, if feasible, to prevent further disruptions until there's confirmation of a resolution or improvement. Engaging with community forums will also provide real-time peer insights and support.
