   Considering the rising threat from groups like Volt Typhoon, cybersecurity professionals in critical infrastructure sectors should invest in training and skill development. Enrolling in courses such as those offered by Pluralsight can enhance their ability to detect and combat sophisticated cyber threats. Organizations should also evaluate current detection and defense mechanisms, update incident response plans, and ensure that their cybersecurity teams are knowledgeable about the latest adversarial tactics and techniques to effectively defend against these state-sponsored threats.
