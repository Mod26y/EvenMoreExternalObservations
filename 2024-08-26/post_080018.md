**1) What happened:**
The American Radio Relay League (ARRL), a national association for amateur radio, faced a significant cybersecurity incident in May, resulting in their systems being encrypted by a ransomware attack. Following the incident, ARRL paid a $1 million ransom to the attackers to obtain a decryptor to restore their systems. The attack, attributed to an international cyber group, impacted approximately 150 employees. The organization utilized insurance to cover most of the ransom and restoration costs, and they are in the process of rebuilding their affected systems under new guidelines and standards.

**2) Why it matters:**
This incident is important because it highlights the ongoing threat and financial burden that ransomware attacks pose to organizations, even those with limited resources like non-profits. The significant ransom payment demonstrates the costly impact of such cyberattacks and the potential for disruptions to critical operations. Additionally, the fact that the ransom was partially covered by insurance points to a growing trend where organizations rely on cyber insurance to mitigate financial risks, which may indirectly encourage cybercriminals by ensuring they get paid.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**
In light of the ARRL attack, organizations should enhance their ransomware preparedness by investing in robust cybersecurity measures, including regular backups, advanced threat detection, and response capabilities. Conducting frequent training programs to educate employees on phishing and other attack vectors can reduce the likelihood of an initial breach. Furthermore, organizations should review and possibly bolster their cyber insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage while considering the potential moral hazard of paying ransoms. Continuous improvement of incident response plans and security infrastructure should also be prioritized to minimize downtime and data loss in case of future incidents.
