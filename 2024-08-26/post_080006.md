**What Happened:**
An audit conducted by the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) uncovered significant weaknesses in the FBI's management and disposal of electronic storage media containing sensitive and classified information. Key findings included inadequate tracking and accounting for storage media, inconsistent labeling of media with appropriate classification levels, and insufficient physical security measures at the FBI facility where media destruction occurs. The FBI has acknowledged these issues and is in the process of implementing corrective actions based on OIGâ€™s recommendations.

**Why it Matters:**
This matters because inadequate management and security of electronic storage media containing sensitive and classified information pose significant risks, including the loss, theft, or unauthorized access to potentially critical national security information. Such breaches could lead to severe consequences such as espionage, undermining of national security, and erosion of public trust in federal institutions. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial to ensuring that sensitive information is properly safeguarded from internal and external threats.

**Actions to be Taken:**
Based on this information, the County's information security steering committee should consider reviewing and possibly strengthening its own inventory management and disposal procedures for electronic storage media. This could include ensuring all electronic storage media are appropriately accounted for, tracked, and marked with the correct classification levels. The committee may also look into enhancing physical security measures, such as implementing stringent access controls, secure storage solutions, and effective surveillance systems. Regular audits and consistent enforcement of policies will help in maintaining robust security practices.
