**1) What happened:** An ingestion bug in Adobe Analytics occurred due to a performance optimization change on September 17, 2025, leading to data from some organizations being visible in the analytics reports of others for about a day. This bug resulted in incorrect data appearing in Analysis Workspace reports and affected several services like Data Collection and Customer Attributes. Approximately 3-5% of collected data was corrupted, and Adobe engineering teams have been working to clean the affected datasets. The issue was not due to a cybersecurity incident, and Adobe reversed the problematic change on September 18, 2025.

**2) Why it matters:** This incident is significant as it potentially exposed sensitive customer data between organizations, leading to privacy and compliance risks under regulations such as GDPR and CPPA. Misallocated data could lead to unauthorized access to personally identifiable information and confidential business data, impacting customer trust and business operations. Moreover, the bug's effects on downstream systems and backups complicate the cleanup process, magnifying the incident's impact on business intelligence systems and external integrations.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:** Impacted organizations are advised to delete all data received during the specified incident window from their systems and backups to prevent further unauthorized data retention or use. They should audit any downstream systems and integrations that ingested the corrupted data to ensure complete removal. Additionally, organizations may need to review their data sharing and handling policies to prevent similar incidents and evaluate compliance risks tied to data exposure. Close communication with Adobe for updates on the cleanup process and future risk mitigation strategies is also essential.
