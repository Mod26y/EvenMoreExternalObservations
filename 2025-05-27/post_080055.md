**What happened:** OpenAI has announced that its AI tool, Deep Research, integrated within ChatGPT, now supports connecting to Dropbox and Box for pulling data. This feature enables users to link their cloud storage accounts, allowing the AI to access documents stored in these services, although GitHub and OneDrive integrations existed prior. This development allows Deep Research to access and utilize user-uploaded PDFs and cloud-stored data for generating research papers or summaries, tapping into a wider array of document resources.

**Why it matters:** This update expands the capabilities of AI-powered research tools, enabling a comprehensive and personalized data analysis experience by including cloud storage service integrations. By drawing from a user's own stored files, Deep Research can provide more tailored and relevant insights, enhancing productivity and decision-making. From an organizational perspective, this integration could also increase data security concerns, as granting an AI tool access to sensitive documents necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations should evaluate the security implications of integrating cloud storage with AI tools like Deep Research. It is advisable to conduct thorough risk assessments and ensure that any integration complies with data protection policies. Security teams should monitor access to cloud-stored files and implement appropriate access controls and encryption. Educating employees about potential risks and safe practices when linking personal or work-related accounts to such AI tools could further mitigate security threats. Regular audits and reviews of AI integrations can help maintain a secure and efficient operating environment.
