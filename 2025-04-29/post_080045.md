On April 25, 2024, a highly critical security flaw identified as CVE-2025-31324 was revealed within SAP NetWeaver's Visual Composer component. Over 1,200 internet-exposed instances of SAP NetWeaver are vulnerable to this unauthenticated file upload flaw, permitting attackers to execute arbitrary code and compromise the servers. This issue has been actively exploited, with attackers deploying webshells on compromised systems. Major organizations, including some in the Fortune 500, are among the victims of this exploitation, highlighting widespread vulnerability.

This vulnerability is significant due to SAP NetWeaver's prevalence in large enterprises and multinational corporations. The potential for attackers to gain unauthorized access to critical systems could lead to data breaches, disruption of services, and significant financial and reputational damage. The widespread nature of the vulnerability, impacting various high-profile organizations, underscores the critical need for immediate remediation to safeguard sensitive systems from exploitation.

Organizations leveraging SAP NetWeaver should promptly apply the latest security updates issued by SAP. Those unable to update promptly should implement mitigations such as restricting access to vulnerable endpoints and disabling unused components like Visual Composer. Additionally, security teams should enhance their monitoring by forwarding logs to a SIEM and employing tools to identify unauthorized webshells. RedRays' scanner tool for CVE-2025-31324 can assist in assessing potential risks within environments, enabling organizations to take proactive measures to mitigate exposure.
