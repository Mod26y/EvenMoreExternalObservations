1) In the VeriSource data breach, the firm revealed that the personal information of four million individuals was exposed. The breach, identified on February 28, 2024, was initially unquantified until April 2025. Sensitive data, including names, addresses, dates of birth, gender, and Social Security numbers, were potentially accessed by unauthorized parties. Although notifications were previously sent to a subset of affected people, the full extent of the exposure was only recently acknowledged.

2) This breach is significant due to the sheer volume of affected individuals and the sensitivity of the personal data involved. Such information can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other forms of cybercrime. The delayed notification highlights challenges in promptly identifying and responding to data breaches, emphasizing the importance of robust incident detection and response mechanisms.

3) Organizations should review their data protection and breach notification processes to enhance detection capabilities and response timeliness. It is important to implement strong security measures such as encryption and access controls to protect sensitive data. Affected individuals are advised to utilize the offered credit monitoring services and maintain vigilance against potential fraud or phishing attacks. Engaging in regular audits and updating cybersecurity strategies can help prevent similar incidents in the future.
