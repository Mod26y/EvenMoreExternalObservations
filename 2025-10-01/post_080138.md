1) The article likely discusses the emergence of "shadow AI," referring to unauthorized or unmonitored use of artificial intelligence tools within organizations. This can happen when employees independently adopt AI solutions without the knowledge or approval of IT departments. As AI becomes more prevalent in business operations, unverified deployments pose risks such as data breaches, compliance violations, and compromised decision-making processes.

2) This issue is significant as it introduces potential security vulnerabilities and operational inefficiencies. Shadow AI can lead to exposure of sensitive data, jeopardizing organizational security and privacy. Moreover, it may cause discrepancies in compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA, given that unsanctioned AI activities might not align with legal standards. This uncoordinated deployment also hinders comprehensive IT governance.

3) Organizations could focus on increasing awareness and establishing clear policies about AI usage. Conducting regular audits to identify unauthorized AI tools, coupled with fostering open communication between IT and other departments, may mitigate risks. Implementing centralized AI governance frameworks that define the permitted use and secure integration of AI tools, alongside providing training to employees about AI-related risks, might further enhance security and compliance.
