1) What happened: Romania's election infrastructure faced an intense wave of cyberattacks, exceeding 85,000 attempts, primarily aiming to breach, compromise, or manipulate election data and systems. Credentials for significant election-related websites were stolen and shared on a Russian hacker forum. The attacks exploited vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting from devices across 33 countries. Additionally, over 100 TikTok influencers were engaged in an influence campaign promoting presidential candidate Calin Georgescu, starting shortly before the elections, potentially indicating a coordinated effort to sway election outcomes and public perception.

2) Why it matters: The cyberattacks and subsequent influence campaign highlight vulnerabilities in democratic processes, extending beyond just technical breaches to include psychological operations aimed at influencing voters. The situation illustrates the reality and sophistication of state-sponsored or state-actor-like threats to election integrity, crucially affecting public trust in the electoral process. The use of influencers to spread political content underscores the evolving tactics utilized in modern cyber and influence operations, marking a significant shift in how elections can be manipulated, impacting national security, democratic institutions, and regional geopolitical stability.

3) What actions should be taken: Strengthening cybersecurity measures for election infrastructure is imperative, focusing on vulnerability assessments and secure network configurations to prevent unauthorized access. This entails training staff on recognizing cybersecurity threats and verifying the authenticity of accessed systems. Implementing tighter controls over social media influence by monitoring and regulating election-related content can mitigate information campaigns. Collaborating with international allies for intelligence sharing will improve readiness against foreign influence threats. Further, developing public awareness initiatives to educate citizens on identifying disinformation will bolster societal resilience against psychological operations aiming to manipulate public opinion.
