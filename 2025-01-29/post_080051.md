The security researchers have identified new side-channel vulnerabilities in Apple's modern processors, specifically targeting speculative executionâ€”similar to past vulnerabilities like Spectre and Meltdown. Named FLOP and SLAP, these attacks explore different methods of exploiting incorrect speculative predictions made by Apple's CPUs, allowing for unauthorized data extraction from web browsers such as Safari and Chrome. These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely via malicious JavaScript or WebAssembly code, potentially exposing sensitive information like personal data and calendar events by tricking CPUs into making predictive errors.

These findings are crucial as they highlight serious vulnerabilities in the latest Apple hardware. Given the widespread use of these affected devices and brands, FLOP and SLAP attacks can have far-reaching consequences by enabling attackers to breach user privacy and security remotely. The attacks can circumvent traditional security measures like browser sandboxing and memory protections, making them highly potent. Given the unmitigated status of these vulnerabilities, there is an immediate need for user awareness and potential temporary protective measures until patches are released.

To counteract the threat posed by these vulnerabilities, users are advised to consider disabling JavaScript in their web browsers temporarily, though this may impact website functionality. This action should ideally be short-term until Apple releases appropriate security patches. Organizations should ensure they are ready to apply updates as soon as they become available. Additionally, raising awareness about these risks and vigilant monitoring of web interactions can help mitigate potential exploits. Regular security audits and staying informed on the latest updates from Apple regarding these vulnerabilities are also recommended.
