**What happened:** Cisco introduced enhanced security measures in their ASA and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) solutions to combat brute-force and password spray attacks on VPNs. These attacks, which Cisco disclosed in April, were causing unauthorized access attempts and could lead to denial-of-service conditions. The updates include features to detect and block unusual VPN access attempts, manage repeated connection trials, and prevent unauthorized authentication requests, minimizing the potential damage these attacks can inflict on network resources.

**Why it matters:** These new features are crucial as brute-force and password spray attacks can lead to unauthorized network access and significant service disruptions, potentially resulting in data breaches and operational downtime. The resilience of network infrastructure is particularly essential for entities like US County information systems that deal with sensitive and crucial data. By addressing these vulnerabilities, Cisco has strengthened the defenses against such threats, which are often precursors to more severe cybersecurity incidents such as ransomware attacks.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations using Cisco ASA and FTD should ensure their devices are running supported software versions to enable these new features. Security teams should configure threat detection capabilities as recommended to mitigate the risk of VPN brute-force attacks effectively. Regularly reviewing resource utilization and monitoring for any potential false positives from these features is advisable to ensure network performance is not adversely affected. Additionally, keeping abreast of Cisco updates and continuing education on emerging cyber threats can further bolster their security posture.
