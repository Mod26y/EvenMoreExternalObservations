Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-windows-driver-signature-bypass-allows-kernel-rootkit-installs/

1) **What Happened:** A new exploit allows attackers to bypass Windows security features and install rootkits on fully patched systems. This is achieved by using a downgrade attack on the Windows Update process, enabling the introduction of outdated, vulnerable software components. The method bypasses Driver Signature Enforcement by loading old DLLs, thereby neutralizing protections against unsigned drivers. Researchers showcased this vulnerability at security conferences and emphasized that the attack involves administrator privileges, making fully updated systems susceptible to past, known vulnerabilities.

2) **Why It Matters:** This vulnerability is significant as it undermines the concept of a "fully patched" system, which forms the foundation for maintaining cybersecurity hygiene. Organizations rely heavily on updates to shield their systems from vulnerabilities, and this approach allows attackers to introduce known weaknesses back into the system. Consequently, it poses a critical risk to systems that are mistakenly considered secure and could lead to potentially severe breaches and undetected malware persistence, given the rootkit installation capabilities.

3) **Actions to be Taken:** Security teams should enhance monitoring for unusual downgrade behavior in Windows Update processes, particularly on systems with administrative access. Solutions could include deploying endpoint protection that flags downgrades or unsigned driver installations. Organizations should also review their privilege management strategies to limit administrative access and assess whether UEFI and registry configurations are fully secured. Continued engagement with Microsoft for timely updates is crucial, and teams might consider utilizing alternative security solutions that can provide mitigation strategies while awaiting official patches.
