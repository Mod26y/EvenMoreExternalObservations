**What Happened:**  
Asana identified a flaw in their Model Context Protocol (MCP) feature that led to data exposure among different organizations using the platform. The flaw was a logic error in the MCP server, which facilitated cross-organization data leaks over a period of more than a month. While the entire dataset of an organization wasn’t publicly leaked, some task-level data, project metadata, and other sensitive information might have been exposed to other MCP-enabled users within different organizations. The flawed feature was related to Asana's large language model (LLM) integration.

**Why It Matters:**  
This incident underscores the potential risks associated with incorporating AI and LLM features into business applications. Even without malicious hacking, logic errors can lead to significant data exposure, impacting an organization’s privacy and compliance posture. Asana, a widely-used platform across various organizations globally, handling sensitive project and task information, places affected entities at risk of privacy breaches and regulatory scrutiny. This incident also reflects the importance of robust testing and monitoring when deploying new technological features, especially those involving data handling and external integrations.

**What Actions Should Be Taken:**  
Organizations affected should immediately review their Asana logs to identify unauthorized access or data leaks related to the MCP feature. Reviewing AI-generated content for inconsistencies or unexpected external data is also advisable. To mitigate similar exposure risks, it's prudent to restrict LLM integration access and pause automatic re-connections. Engaging in transparent communication with Asana to understand the extent of exposure and comply with regulatory notification requirements is crucial. Re-evaluating and enhancing security measures around AI integrations can prevent future occurrences, ensuring all stakeholders' data protection expectations are met diligently.
