**1) What Happened:**
Instagram ads, falsely claiming to be from reputable Canadian banks like the Bank of Montreal (BMO) and EQ Bank, are scamming users through AI-powered deepfakes and phishing strategies. These ads, which mimic legitimate bank branding, redirect users to fraudulent websites to steal their personal and banking credentials. Some scams involve AI deepfake videos of well-known financial figures to gain trust and lure individuals into providing sensitive information or joining fake investment groups.

**2) Why It Matters:**
This event underscores the evolving sophistication in cybercriminal techniques, particularly leveraging AI deepfakes. Such methods make scams more convincing, increasing the likelihood of users falling victim to phishing. The use of official branding and social media platforms like Instagram to propagate these scams highlights vulnerabilities in both the advertising ecosystem and user awareness. It emphasizes the need for heightened cybersecurity vigilance and more robust anti-fraud mechanisms.

**3) What Actions Should be Taken:**
Organizations should enhance their monitoring of social media channels for brand impersonation and educate users about recognizing and reporting phishing attempts. Financial institutions must reinforce communications with customers, advising them to verify promotions through official channels. Users should be encouraged to critically evaluate online offers, especially when they appear overly lucrative. Furthermore, social media platforms must improve their ad vetting processes to swiftly identify and remove fraudulent content, collaborating closely with affected brands.
