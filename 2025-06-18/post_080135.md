Apologies for the inconvenience caused by the unavailability of the article. Based on the title, "The Cyber Future Is Riskier Than You Think," we can consider this piece likely discusses the increasing complexities and threats in the cybersecurity landscape.

1) Given recent trends, the article likely discusses how the cyber threat environment is evolving, with more sophisticated attacks, increased connectivity, and a rise in vulnerabilities due to the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and remote work. With attackers employing more advanced tactics daily, organizations face heightened risks to their systems and data.

2) This situation matters because organizations must secure not just traditional IT infrastructure but also manage risks associated with emerging technologies. Failing to understand the evolving threat landscape can result in significant financial losses, reputational damage, and compromised personal data, all of which have far-reaching consequences for businesses and individuals alike.

3) To mitigate these growing threats, organizations could adopt a proactive cybersecurity posture. Conducting regular risk assessments and security audits, investing in advanced threat detection and response technologies, and fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness and training among employees are essential. Collaborating with external cybersecurity experts and remaining informed on the latest threat intelligence could also enhance defenses against evolving cyber threats.
