**What happened:** The article likely discusses the issue of rogue access in cybersecurity, which refers to unauthorized individuals gaining access to systems or data within an organization. This can occur due to improper access controls, insider threats, or external attackers exploiting vulnerabilities. Without access to the article, we can presume the emphasis is on the dangers posed by such unauthorized access and potential breaches that could compromise sensitive information.

**Why it matters:** Rogue access is a critical concern as it undermines the security posture of an organization. Unauthorized access can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. It is particularly important for large entities like a county's information system to safeguard against such threats, as they manage extensive amounts of confidential and sensitive public data.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations should evaluate and strengthen their access control policies by implementing measures such as multi-factor authentication, regular audits of access logs, and employee education on cybersecurity awareness. Additionally, deploying advanced threat detection and response solutions can help identify and mitigate rogue access attempts in real-time, enhancing the organization's overall security framework.
