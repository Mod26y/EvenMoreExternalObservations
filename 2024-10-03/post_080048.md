**What happened:**  
Microsoft has launched Office 2024 for Windows and macOS with major updates and security enhancements, offering it as a standalone purchase rather than requiring a Microsoft 365 subscription. This release includes updated versions of essential Office applications and new features like support for OpenDocument Format (ODF) 1.4 and improved document recovery. Notably, Microsoft has disabled ActiveX controls by default in response to past security breaches exploiting ActiveX vulnerabilities. This step is part of broader security improvements, addressing potential malware risks from hackers who have historically targeted these controls.

**Why it matters:**  
This new Office release is significant as it addresses long-standing security concerns, particularly by disabling ActiveX controls, previously exploited in cyberattacks. For organizations and users hesitant about subscription-based models, Office 2024 offers an alternative that still prioritizes security. The focus on security is crucial, as vulnerabilities in widely-used software can serve as entry points for cyberattacks, including malware and data theft. Additionally, the improvements in efficiency and interface could boost productivity, making it more appealing to businesses and consumers seeking reliable and secure office applications.

**What actions should be taken:**  
Organizations should evaluate the potential benefits of upgrading to Office 2024, focusing on its security enhancements, particularly the deactivation of ActiveX controls. Updating corporate security policies to align with these changes could reduce exposure to malware threats. IT departments should conduct compatibility assessments and prepare support teams for possible user interface adaptations. Additionally, it's advisable to prepare user education or training sessions to maximize the benefits of the new functionalities in Office 2024, such as document recovery, which could improve data preservation in unexpected software crashes.
