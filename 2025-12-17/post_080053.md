1) **What happened:** Afripol, a policy-making and policing organization in Africa, is concentrating on regional cybersecurity challenges by enhancing collaboration among African nations. This approach highlights the organization's commitment to coordinating efforts against cyber threats, which are increasingly affecting the region. The initiative aims to foster knowledge sharing, strengthen defensive capabilities, and improve incident response among African countries.

2) **Why it matters:** Enhanced regional cooperation on cybersecurity is vital as cyber threats do not respect national borders and can have widespread impacts. By deepening cooperation, Afripol can help build a cohesive framework to address complex cybersecurity issues, which is crucial for protecting critical infrastructure, sensitive data, and maintaining stability in the region. This collective effort may also improve the global cybersecurity posture by reducing vulnerabilities that can be exploited internationally.

3) **What actions should be taken:** Organizations similar to Afripol within different regions, including those in the US, might consider adopting and tailoring Afripol's collaborative approach to strengthen cybersecurity. It is beneficial to review and foster international collaboration, as well as invest in capacity-building initiatives, to enhance mutual defense mechanisms. For the steering committee, focusing on establishing strong partnerships with international cybersecurity entities can improve overall cyber risk management and preparedness.
