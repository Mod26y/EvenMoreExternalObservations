Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cellik-android-malware-builds-malicious-versions-from-google-play-apps/

**1) What happened?**

Cellik, a new malware-as-a-service aimed at Android devices, was discovered being sold on cybercrime forums. It allows cybercriminals to create malicious versions of legitimate Google Play Store apps. This malware can remain disguised by retaining the real app's interface and functionality. It boasts features like screen capturing, notification interception, filesystem browsing, data exfiltration, and encrypted command-and-control communication. Cellik can even inject harmful payloads into trusted apps, making detection difficult. It is marketed as a tool potentially capable of evading Google Play Protect, although this claim has not been verified.

**2) Why it matters?**

Cellik poses a significant threat to Android users by exploiting trust in Google Play Store apps. Its ability to embed itself in genuine apps means it could easily slip past standard security measures, putting a large number of devices at risk. The capability of real-time screen monitoring and data theft has wide-ranging implications for privacy, security, and potentially even financial losses. This exemplifies the evolving sophistication of cyber threats and highlights the limitations of existing security infrastructure, impacting user trust and the responsibility of app stores to ensure the safety of their platforms.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

Organizations and individuals should enhance their awareness and response strategies toward mobile security threats. Users should be cautious by avoiding sideloading apps from unverified sources, actively using tools like Google Play Protect, and vigilant in monitoring app permissions and device behavior. Security teams should integrate machine learning-based anomaly detection to identify unusual app behaviors. Developers and app stores like Google may need to improve security screening methods to detect trojanized apps. Regular security training on mobile threats for both developers and end-users can further bolster defense mechanisms against sophisticated malware like Cellik.
