Hackers took advantage of critical-severity vulnerabilities in Fortinet products, specifically involving FortiCloud SSO authentication bypass flaws. These vulnerabilities, identified as CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719, allow unauthorized access to admin accounts and enable the stealing of system configuration files. This attack method entails submitting maliciously crafted SAML assertions, thus enabling unauthorized login. According to observed instances, hackers obtained admin-level access and exfiltrated vital configuration files, which could reveal sensitive information, including network structures and firewall policies.

The importance of this issue lies in its potential to lead to future targeted attacks, since configuration files extracted by hackers can shed light on an organization’s network infrastructure and security mechanisms. Such intelligence could further facilitate the exploitation of weak points within a network. Furthermore, unauthorized access to admin accounts heightens the risk of malicious activities on the network, posing serious security threats to organizations using Fortinet products.

As a response, administrators are encouraged to either upgrade affected Fortinet products to newer versions not vulnerable to these exploits or temporarily disable the FortiCloud SSO login feature to mitigate risk. Alongside this, it is advisable to conduct comprehensive network assessments to identify signs of compromise, rotate firewall credentials if necessary, and restrict firewall/VPN management access to trusted internal networks. These actions could offer a more secure operational environment by limiting the exploitability of existing vulnerabilities and safeguarding sensitive data.
