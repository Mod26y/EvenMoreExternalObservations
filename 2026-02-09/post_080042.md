State-sponsored threat actors are targeting high-ranking individuals in Germany and Europe through phishing attacks on messaging apps like Signal. These attacks exploit social engineering rather than technical vulnerabilities, aiming to access data from politicians, military officers, and journalists. The attackers impersonate messaging service support to trick targets into surrendering account access, either through shared verification codes for full account takeover or by exploiting Signal's linked-device feature to surreptitiously pair with their device for ongoing monitoring. The BfV and BSI issued this advisory based on gathered intelligence to warn potential targets.

This situation is significant because it highlights a sophisticated, malware-free phishing technique that poses a risk to high-value targets’ communications, potentially compromising sensitive political, military, and journalistic information. By exploiting legitimate app features, these attacks can evade some typical threat detection methods, raising the cybersecurity stakes for those handling sensitive information. The nature of these communications makes the threat particularly impactful, as it can influence international relations and internal security if sensitive data is intercepted by foreign state actors.

To mitigate this risk, users should be cautious of messages from supposed support accounts and avoid sharing sensitive authentication details. Blocking and reporting such impostor accounts can help prevent the spread of these schemes. Signal users are encouraged to activate the 'Registration Lock' to ensure a PIN is necessary for new device registration and regularly review the list of devices linked to their account. Staying vigilant about the potential abuse of QR code pairing on other platforms like WhatsApp is also advisable, given that similar tactics have been observed there.
