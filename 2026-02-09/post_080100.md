Unfortunately, the article's content cannot be accessed due to a 403 error. However, based on the title provided and general knowledge in the field, I can discuss the likely implications of the "Encrypt It Already" campaign.

1) The "Encrypt It Already" campaign likely advocates for major technology companies to implement end-to-end (E2E) encryption. This form of encryption ensures that only the intended recipients can access the data, thus improving security and privacy by preventing unauthorized access, even from the service providers themselves. The initiative aims to push Big Tech to prioritize secure communications and data protection for users across their platforms.

2) This campaign matters because end-to-end encryption is a cornerstone of digital privacy and security. With increasing data breaches and concerns over mass surveillance, prioritizing E2E encryption can prevent unauthorized data access, preserving user privacy and fostering trust in digital services. It can defend against cyber threats and mitigate risks associated with data interception or misuse, making it essential for protecting sensitive information.

3) Organizations should evaluate their current data encryption policies and, if applicable, implement measures to adopt or enhance end-to-end encryption across their services. Stakeholders could educate their staff and users about the benefits of E2E encryption to raise awareness and promote adoption. Collaborating with other businesses in lobbying efforts could also amplify the push for legislative support for stronger encryption standards to better protect consumer data.
