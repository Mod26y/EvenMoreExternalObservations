1) The title suggests the article discusses the Shai-hulud supply chain attack, emphasizing its hidden costs. Typically, supply chain attacks involve compromised third-party services or software to gain unauthorized access to an organization's systems. The focus on "hidden cost" likely explores the long-term impacts such as operational disruptions, reputational damage, and financial burdens that go beyond immediate breach response costs.

2) Understanding these hidden costs is crucial as supply chain attacks can be stealthy, affecting many organizations simultaneously. They can undermine trust in widely-used vendors and lead to broader systemic risks within various sectors. Effective mitigation requires not just immediate technical fixes but also strategic planning to address broader risk dimensions such as compliance and public perception.

3) Organizations should enhance supply chain risk management by vetting vendors, enforcing contractual security requirements, and employing continuous monitoring of third-party interactions. Investing in collaborative threat intelligence sharing with industry partners could provide early warnings of emerging threats. Additionally, conducting regular audits and simulating supply chain attack scenarios could enhance an organization's preparedness and response capabilities, ensuring resiliency against complex threats.
