### What Happened:

Check Point Software and Cisco announced agreements to acquire artificial intelligence (AI)-focused startups this week. Check Point is purchasing Cyberint, which focuses on external risk management, while Cisco is acquiring Robust Intelligence, a company specializing in AI risk assessment and threat detection. Both companies are integrating these newly acquired technologies into their existing security platforms, aiming to bolster their AI capabilities. These deals follow Cisco's recent substantial investments in the AI sector, reflecting an industry-wide trend of prioritizing AI-driven cybersecurity advancements.

### Why It Matters:

These acquisitions signify a broader industry trend toward integrating AI to enhance cybersecurity measures. With the increasing deployment of AI-enabled applications, vulnerabilities and risks in these models are becoming critical concerns. Check Point's acquisition of Cyberint will enhance its threat intelligence and attack surface management capabilities, making its platform more comprehensive. Similarly, Ciscoâ€™s acquisition of Robust Intelligence will boost its AI model risk assessment and security, safeguarding customers against potential vulnerabilities. This focus on AI underscores the need for advanced technologies to manage and mitigate the complexities associated with modern cybersecurity threats.

### What Actions Should Be Taken:

Information security steering committees should consider expanding their AI initiatives to align with these industry advancements. Assessing current AI integration in security protocols could uncover potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. Collaborating with AI-focused cybersecurity firms could enhance both proactive and reactive security measures. It would be beneficial to stay informed about emerging AI technologies and the latest cybersecurity threats to continuously evolve and strengthen the county's cybersecurity posture. Committees might also evaluate and possibly augment their threat intelligence and model validation mechanisms to combat the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.
