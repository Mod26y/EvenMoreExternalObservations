### What Happened

NASA is placing increased emphasis on cybersecurity within its mission-critical software projects to minimize risks to its operations. The emphasis includes expanding educational outreach programs to build a stronger cybersecurity workforce. The Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility (IV&V) traditionally focused on identifying bugs that could lead to mission failures but has now extended its mandate to include cybersecurity evaluations. This effort is driven by a need to independently assess the design, architecture, and structures of space systems. Currently, the IV&V has a small team of cybersecurity practitioners, which it plans to expand.

### Why it Matters

The cybersecurity focus at NASA is crucial because mission-critical software is integral to the success of space missions and the protection of sensitive data. By integrating cybersecurity rigor into software evaluations, NASA aims to preempt potential cyber threats that could compromise mission outcomes. This initiative aligns with broader national security concerns, given that space systems are integral to defense, communications, and other critical infrastructures. Additionally, building a robust cybersecurity workforce through educational initiatives addresses long-term needs for skilled professionals capable of safeguarding complex technological systems.

### Actions to be Taken

Organizations, especially those handling sensitive or mission-critical data, can take a cue from NASA by integrating cybersecurity evaluations into their software development lifecycle. Investing in educational outreach and internship programs to grow a knowledgeable cybersecurity workforce is equally important. Collaborating with academic institutions to develop targeted curricula can close the talent gap in cybersecurity. Furthermore, expanding internal teams dedicated to cybersecurity assessments and integrating these roles with traditional assurance and software engineering roles can ensure a more robust and comprehensive security posture.
