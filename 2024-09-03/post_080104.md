1) What Happened:
A Russian-backed threat actor known as APT29, Cozy Bear, or Midnight Blizzard, leveraged previously known mobile exploits, used by commercial surveillance vendors Intellexa and NSO Group, to conduct exploit campaigns. These campaigns, identified by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG), involved watering-hole attacks on Mongolian government websites, exploiting vulnerabilities in iOS and Chrome on Android devices to hijack visitor devices. The campaigns were observed on three separate occasions, with one as recent as a month ago. These exploits included a known vulnerability, CVE-2023-41993, before it was patched.

2) Why It Matters:
This incident underscores a significant security threat: the crossover of sophisticated exploits from commercial spyware vendors to state-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. These exploits, initially operational as zero-day vulnerabilities by entities like Intellexa and NSO Group, become potentially more hazardous as they are repurposed by APT actors for broader, possibly geopolitical or national security-related, cyberattacks. Such activity heightens the risk for governments, organizations, and individuals globally, indicating a strong need for immediate and continuous patch management and threat monitoring.

3) What Actions Should Be Taken:
To mitigate risks from such crossover exploits, several steps are recommended. First, entities should prioritize the timely deployment of patches for known vulnerabilities like CVE-2023-41993. Enhanced monitoring of threat intelligence for signs of similar exploits and APT activities is crucial. Establishing strong relationships with IT and cybersecurity vendors to ensure up-to-date security solutions and insights may also enhance defenses. Additionally, it is advisable to review and strengthen incident response and recovery plans to quickly address compromised systems, limiting potential damage when new exploits surface.
