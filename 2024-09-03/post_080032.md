**1) What happened?**

CBIZ Benefits & Insurance Services (CBIZ), a management consulting company, experienced a data breach due to an exploited vulnerability on one of its web pages. Between June 2 and June 21, 2024, a threat actor gained unauthorized access to client databases, stealing information belonging to approximately 36,000 individuals. The compromised data includes names, contact details, Social Security numbers, dates of birth or death, retiree health information, and welfare plan information. The breach was discovered on June 24, 2024, following an investigation with cybersecurity professionals. Impacted clients began receiving notifications on August 28, 2024.

**2) Why it matters?**

This incident is significant due to the sensitivity and volume of the data compromised, including Social Security numbers and health information. Such data breaches can lead to severe consequences for affected individuals, such as identity theft and financial fraud. As CBIZ is a major player in providing professional services, including financial and insurance solutions, the breach undermines client trust and can have reputational and financial repercussions for the company. The incident also highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information and preemptively mitigate vulnerabilities. 

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

CBIZ should intensify its cybersecurity efforts, including conducting comprehensive security audits and penetration tests to identify and rectify vulnerabilities. Clients impacted by the breach should promptly enroll in the offered credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. They may also want to implement additional precautions such as placing a credit/security freeze and adding fraud alerts to their credit reports. Furthermore, organizations partnering with third-party services should review their own security protocols to ensure they are not at risk from vulnerabilities in their partners' systems. Enhanced awareness and training on cybersecurity best practices among employees can also serve as a preventive measure against future breaches.
