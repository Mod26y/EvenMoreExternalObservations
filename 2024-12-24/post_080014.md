1) The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has mandated that Marriott International and its subsidiary Starwood Hotels establish a comprehensive data security program after significant data breaches affected 344 million customers globally. Notable breaches included compromised guest records between 2014 and 2018, during which sensitive data such as unencrypted passport numbers was exposed. The mandate encompasses several security measures, including encryption, access controls, and incident response plans, with Marriott also required to involve third-party assessment of their security program and to provide transparency features for consumers regarding their data.

2) This order is significant as it reinforces the need for robust data security measures within the hospitality industry, which deals with vast amounts of sensitive customer information. The breaches highlighted severe gaps in data protection, demonstrating the potential risks and impacts on consumer trust when security is inadequate. It underscores the importance of proactive security governance and compliance with regulatory standards to protect consumer data, prevent financial losses, and avoid reputational damage alongside financial penalties.

3) As a response to this incident, organizations, especially those handling personal and sensitive data, should evaluate their own cybersecurity frameworks. Key actions may include implementing multi-factor authentication, regular vulnerability assessments, real-time monitoring for suspicious activity, and having comprehensive incident response plans. Moreover, conducting regular, third-party audits of security practices, enhancing transparency about data handling and storage policies, and providing consumers with tools to monitor and manage their data are crucial steps to mitigate similar risks. Remaining informed about emerging threats and regulatory changes would also be prudent for maintaining compliance and security effectively.
