A new zero-day vulnerability in NTLM allows attackers to steal NTLM credentials by having users simply view a malicious file within Windows Explorer. This vulnerability is critical as it does not necessitate opening a file and affects all Windows versions from Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 to the latest. Attackers can relay these captured NTLM hashes to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems. The flaw in the NTLM protocol exacerbates risks in environments still relying on NTLM for authentication, even when NTLM v2 is in use, exposing systems to widespread credential theft techniques.

The vulnerability matters because NTLM is still widely used in many environments despite being deprecated, as evidenced by 64% of Active Directory user accounts relying on it. This vulnerability is significant as NTLM transmits password hashes, which can be intercepted and misused for attacks like identity theft and unauthorized access to SaaS environments. The risk is aggravated since modern security measures such as multifactor authentication are incompatible with NTLM, making it imperative for enterprises to address this vulnerability promptly.

To mitigate the vulnerability, organizations should enhance their defenses by enabling Extended Protection for Authentication on LDAP, AD CS, and Exchange Server. Using Group Policy to audit NTLM traffic will identify dependencies on NTLMv2. Implementing SMB signing and encryption can reduce NTLM credential leakage risks. Organizations should consider transitioning to modern protocols like Kerberos and enable multifactor authentication to strengthen security. Regular monitoring of NTLM usage and auditing systems will assist in identifying legacy dependencies, facilitating a strategic move away from NTLM reliance.
