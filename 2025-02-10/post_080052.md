A recent exploit targeting a deserialization vulnerability in Trimble Cityworks, tracked as CVE-2025-0994, allows hackers to execute remote commands on Microsoft IIS servers. This has led to the deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons for initial network intrusions. The vulnerability primarily impacts local governments and utility organizations relying on Cityworks for asset and work order management. Trimble has issued a security update to address this flaw, alerting that some systems may have improper permissions and configurations that could exacerbate the risk.

The exploitation of this vulnerability is significant as it targets essential infrastructure within local governments and public utilities, potentially leading to unauthorized access and service disruptions. The deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons suggests a risk of further lateral movements within affected networks, underscoring the importance of prompt remediation. With sensitive data and critical public services at risk, addressing such vulnerabilities is crucial to maintaining operational integrity and public trust.

To mitigate risks associated with this vulnerability, organizations using affected Cityworks versions are advised to upgrade to the latest releases, 15.8.9 and 23.10. Systems administrators should review all IIS server permissions to prevent improper access levels and reconfigure attachment directories to restrict content appropriately. Monitoring for indicators of compromise (IOCs) provided by Trimble can help in identifying and responding to potential breaches. Additionally, staying informed about guidance from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will aid in strengthening security postures against similar threats.
