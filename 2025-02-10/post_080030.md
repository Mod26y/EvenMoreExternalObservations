Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/massive-brute-force-attack-uses-28-million-ips-to-target-vpn-devices/

**1) What happened:**  
A massive brute force attack is employing nearly 2.8 million IP addresses to guess login credentials for various VPN and security devices from companies like Palo Alto Networks, Ivanti, and SonicWall. The attack primarily utilizes compromised routers and IoTs from brands like MikroTik and Huawei, functioning as part of a larger botnet. These attacks enable unauthorized access to networks by hijacking gateway devices, allowing attackers to route malicious traffic through seemingly legitimate networks, complicating detection efforts.

**2) Why it matters:**  
This attack reveals a significant threat to enterprise network security, as it targets edge devices crucial for remote access. Compromising these devices can provide attackers with a foothold into broader network infrastructures, leading to potential data breaches, espionage, or further malicious activities. The use of a large number of IP addresses from multiple countries increases the attack's complexity and effectiveness. Moreover, utilizing residential proxies makes such activities more challenging to detect and mitigate, posing a continuous risk to organizational cybersecurity.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information:**  
Organizations should take a proactive approach by strengthening the security of their edge devices. This can be achieved by changing default passwords to strong, unique ones, enabling multi-factor authentication, and using allowlists to restrict IP access. Disabling unnecessary web admin interfaces and applying regular firmware and security updates are also crucial in mitigating vulnerabilities. Continuous monitoring for unusual traffic patterns and maintaining robust incident response plans will further enhance defense mechanisms against such large-scale brute force attacks.
