The University of Hawaii Cancer Center suffered a ransomware attack in August 2025, compromising a single research project. The attackers stole data, including sensitive information from the 1990s containing Social Security numbers, affecting study participants but not impacting patient care. The attack disrupted operations, requiring UH to negotiate with the attackers for a decryptor and data deletion assurance. Initial assessments indicated mostly non-personally identifiable research data was affected, but further evaluation revealed older sensitive records were compromised.

This incident underscores the persistent threat of ransomware attacks on educational and research institutions, particularly the risks of using outdated identification methods. The breach highlights the need for robust data protection strategies and illustrates the critical nature of incident response and data recovery plans. It also emphasizes the importance of safeguarding legacy data that may hold sensitive information, to prevent significant privacy and security ramifications for individuals whose data might be exposed.

In response, organizations should consider enhancing their cybersecurity posture by installing advanced endpoint protection, conducting regular security audits, and upgrading vulnerable systems such as firewalls. Additionally, they should prioritize encrypting sensitive legacy data and implementing modern identification practices to mitigate the risk of data exposure. Regular training for staff on identifying phishing attempts and securing personal information would also be beneficial. Improved communication channels are also vital to ensure timely notification of affected individuals when breaches occur.
