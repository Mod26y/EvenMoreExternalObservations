The article discusses a high-severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Gogs, exploited in zero-day attacks. Indexed as CVE-2025-8110, it arises from a path traversal flaw in the PutContents API. This allows authenticated attackers to bypass security measures by overwriting files via symbolic links, potentially executing arbitrary commands. Detected by Wiz Research following a malware infection on a Gogs server, the flaw was acknowledged and patched by Gogs maintainers on October 30, 2023. CISA has corroborated the vulnerability’s impact and ordered federal agencies to patch their systems by February 2, 2026.

The significance of this event lies in the exploitation of a zero-day RCE vulnerability, posing substantial risks to internet-exposed Gogs instances, with over 1,400 identified online. Federal agencies are under explicit directives to secure against this flaw, underscoring its critical threat level. A failure to patch could lead to severe consequences including unauthorized access and control over systems, potentially affecting national security and data integrity within federal systems. Addressing this vulnerability swiftly is crucial to safeguarding IT infrastructures from malicious cyber activities.

In response, affected organizations should apply patches from Gogs promptly to mitigate the vulnerability. Disabling open-registration settings and restricting server access through VPNs or allow lists can further reduce exposure. Administrators should monitor their Gogs instances for unusual activities, focusing on the PutContents API misuse and strange repository creations, to identify potential breaches. Beyond these immediate measures, it’s vital to regularly update security protocols and collaborate with vendors to maintain defenses against emerging threats.
