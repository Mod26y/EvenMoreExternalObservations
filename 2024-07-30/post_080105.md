Cowbell, a provider of cyber insurance specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), has secured $60 million in Series C funding from Zurich Insurance Group.

This investment highlights the critical importance of cybersecurity in today’s business environment, particularly for SMEs that are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals. With cybercrime costs projected to reach $24 trillion by 2027 and ransomware attacks costing SMEs an average of $1.7 million per incident, enhanced cybersecurity services are urgently needed. Zurich’s investment underscores a growing recognition of the necessity to bolster cyber resilience and support risk management in the SME market.

### Actions to Be Taken

Organizations, especially within the SME sector, should consider reassessing their current cybersecurity insurance coverage and risk management strategies. With the advancements in AI and cyber resilience services offered by firms like Cowbell, it may be pertinent to explore new or additional cyber insurance options that provide more tailored and intelligent protection. Additionally, understanding the services provided by advanced cyber insurance platforms can help businesses make more informed decisions regarding their security posture and cyber risk management plans.
