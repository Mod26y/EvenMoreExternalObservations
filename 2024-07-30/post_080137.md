### What Happened
Lakera, a leading company in Generative AI (GenAI) security, successfully raised $20 million in a Series A funding round, bringing its total funding to $30 million. This round was led by Atomico, with contributions from Citi Ventures, Dropbox Ventures, and other existing investors. The funds will help Lakera enhance its product development and expand its US presence, which already includes a foothold in Silicon Valley. This development comes at a crucial time when GenAI is expected to see widespread adoption across various enterprises.

### Why It Matters
This funding milestone underscores the escalating importance of securing GenAI applications, which are anticipated to be used by 80% of enterprises by 2026. The rapid adoption of GenAI brings novel risks that traditional cybersecurity tools can’t address. Vulnerabilities such as prompt attacks and AI "sleeper agents" can have severe consequences, like unauthorized access and data theft. As GenAI could contribute an estimated $4.4 trillion annually to the global GDP, ensuring its secure implementation is critical for both economic and operational sustainability.

### What Actions Should Be Taken
Organizations should evaluate their existing cybersecurity frameworks to assess their readiness for GenAI-specific threats. Investing in solutions like Lakera’s, which provide real-time protection and low-latency security layers, can help mitigate the unique risks posed by GenAI. Additionally, security teams should consider incorporating AI educational platforms like Gandalf to stay updated on emerging threats and vulnerabilities. Updating policies and training programs to include the potential threats posed by GenAI will also be crucial for maintaining robust security protocols.
