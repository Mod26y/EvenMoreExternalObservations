1) The Sangoma FreePBX Security Team discovered a zero-day vulnerability in FreePBX systems with the Administrator Control Panel (ACP) exposed to the internet. This vulnerability, actively exploited since August 21, allows attackers to execute any commands permitted to the asterisk user. Affected systems involve those using versions 16 and 17 with the endpoint module and public internet exposure. The team released an EDGE module fix for testing, with a full security update scheduled soon. However, users without a valid support contract might face difficulties in applying the EDGE fix.

2) This zero-day flaw is critical due to its exploitation in breaching multiple FreePBX servers, which handle essential communication infrastructures for businesses. The breach has impacted 3,000 SIP extensions and 500 trunks, illustrating widespread potential damage. Zero-day vulnerabilities in widely-used platforms pose significant risks, including data theft, reputational harm, and service disruption. These incidents emphasize the importance of proactive security measures and timely updates to secure communication systems that underpin many business operations.

3) Administrators should immediately restrict access to the ACP using a firewall, allowing only trusted hosts. They should apply the EDGE fix if possible, or disconnect ACP access while awaiting the full security update. Systems should be checked for indicators of compromise, such as changes to configuration files or unusual logs, and should restore from backups before August 21 if compromised. Itâ€™s also crucial to rotate credentials and review call records for unauthorized activities. Strengthening network security and ensuring systems are not publicly exposed can mitigate future risks.
