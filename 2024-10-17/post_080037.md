Iranian hackers have infiltrated critical infrastructure sectors to sell access for potential cyberattacks. Their targets include healthcare, government, and energy sectors in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia. By using techniques like brute force and MFA push bombing, these hackers aim to maintain persistent access by collecting credentials. They exploit mismanaged MFA configurations and vulnerabilities such as CVE-2020-1472, employing tools already present on the systems. This activity highlights a shift towards Iranian actors functioning as initial access brokers, facilitating subsequent cybercriminal activity.

This development is significant because critical infrastructure sectors are essential to national security and economic stability. The potential for Iranian hackers to sell access to malicious actors raises the risk of disruptive cyberattacks, potentially leading to compromised sensitive data, financial loss, and threats to public safety. Additionally, this trend indicates an increasing sophistication and collaboration among international threat actors, underscoring the need for robust cybersecurity measures and international cooperation to counteract these threats.

Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity defenses by implementing rigorous monitoring of authentication logs, looking out for signs of credential misuse such as 'impossible logins' or unusual IP activity. Additional security measures include enforcing strong MFA practices and regularly auditing for any suspicious MFA registrations or account activities. Moreover, organizations should continually update firewalls, security patches, and conduct security awareness training for employees. Engaging in threat intelligence sharing and collaborating with governmental cybersecurity bodies can further bolster security against evolving threats.
