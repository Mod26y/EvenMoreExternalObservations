1) In this article, the focus is on electronic warfare activities that target commercial GPS users. Although specific details are inaccessible, it is likely that the discussion revolves around the manipulation or disruption of GPS signals which can result in inaccurate location data or loss of GPS connectivity. This type of interference poses significant challenges to industries relying on GPS for navigation, timing, and other critical operations.

2) The importance of this issue lies in the widespread reliance on GPS across multiple sectors including transportation, telecommunications, and finance. Disruptions to GPS can lead to safety hazards, operational inefficiencies, and economic impacts. Recognizing the vulnerabilities in GPS technology is critical for businesses and public entities to safeguard their operations against potential electronic warfare tactics.

3) As a response, organizations should prioritize strengthening GPS resilience by implementing diverse navigation and timing systems. Conducting regular risk assessments, updating contingency plans, and investing in technologies such as anti-jamming and anti-spoofing solutions can mitigate risks. Furthermore, fostering collaboration with governmental bodies and industry partners can enhance situational awareness and enable coordinated responses to GPS-related threats.
