1) The Cursor and Windsurf IDEs are vulnerable to over 94 known Chromium vulnerabilities because they utilize outdated versions of software, particularly the Electron framework. These IDEs, used by around 1.8 million developers, are based on Visual Studio Code and incorporate old Chromium and V8 engines. Although the vulnerability was disclosed responsibly, Cursor dismissed it as out of scope, and Windsurf has not responded. This inaction persists despite demonstrations of how exploitation, such as via a deeplink triggering a denial-of-service attack, is feasible with these vulnerabilities.

2) This situation is significant because it highlights the risks associated with using outdated software components in widely-used development tools. The presence of known vulnerabilities in these IDEs can lead to denial of service and potentially allow arbitrary code execution, endangering the security of projects and systems developed using them. This scenario underscores the broader issue of maintaining secure software supply chains and keeping all components of a software system up to date to mitigate the risk of exploiting old vulnerabilities.

3) Actions that should be taken include urging software vendors to prioritize regular updates and patches for embedded frameworks like Electron. Organizations using these IDEs should consider collaborating with the vendors to address these vulnerabilities or seek alternative tools that prioritize security updates. Additionally, organizations should educate their developers on the importance of maintaining current software and conducting thorough security assessments of the tools they use. Implementing such measures can help reduce the attack surface and protect against potential exploitations.
