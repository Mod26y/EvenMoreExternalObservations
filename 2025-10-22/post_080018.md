Original Article: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vidar-stealer-20-adds-multi-threaded-data-theft-better-evasion/

1) What happened: The developers of Vidar Stealer have released a major upgrade, Vidar 2.0, enhancing its capability to steal data through multi-threaded processing and sophisticated evasion techniques. Rewritten in C, Vidar 2.0 bypasses recent browser encryption measures, particularly targeting Google Chrome's App-Bound Encrypted data. The updated version collects a broader range of data from infected systems, such as browser cookies, cryptocurrency wallets, and various application credentials. Its advanced anti-analysis features make detection more difficult, leading to a spike in use, filling the gap left by the decline of the Lumma Stealer.

2) Why it matters: This development is significant as Vidar 2.0's enhanced capabilities pose a greater threat to data security, particularly personal and financial information. Its ability to bypass modern browser encryption highlights a dangerous vulnerability in everyday user security. As the malware targets numerous data types, the broad spectrum of potential loss includes sensitive personal data and credentials critical to financial and business operations. These improvements suggest that attacks leveraging Vidar 2.0 are likely to become more frequent and potent, increasing the risk for individuals and organizations alike.

3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information: Organizations should elevate their cybersecurity measures, focusing on improved monitoring and detection capabilities for malware like Vidar Stealer. It's important to regularly update browser and app security, implementing measures that mitigate the risk posed by memory-injection techniques. Investing in advanced endpoint protection that detects subtle evasive maneuvers and multi-threaded activities can be valuable. Employee awareness and training on avoiding phishing and unusual apps or browser extensions are critical. Continuous assessment of security posture, coupled with timely patch management, will help protect against data breaches.
