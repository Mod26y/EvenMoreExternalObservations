The Ghost Calls tactic, discovered by Praetorian's Adam Crosser, abuses TURN servers used in video conferencing apps like Zoom and Microsoft Teams to establish a covert command-and-control (C2) channel. It exploits the WebRTC and TURN protocols to route malicious traffic through trusted infrastructure, making it indistinguishable from normal enterprise traffic and allowing it to bypass conventional security measures. This approach enables attackers to conduct operations without exposing their infrastructure and utilize reliable, high-performance connections.

The significance of this discovery lies in its potential to bypass traditional security defenses like firewalls and intrusion detection systems by blending malicious traffic with regular video conferencing data. This tactic could be misused by cybercriminals for data exfiltration or further attacks, presenting a significant risk to organizations that rely on these communication platforms. By hiding under the guise of legitimate traffic, Ghost Calls could facilitate undetected breaches and command-and-control activities on compromised systems.

Organizations should consider enhancing their monitoring capabilities to include detection of anomalous WebRTC and TURN traffic patterns. Security teams might explore deploying additional behavioral analysis tools that can spot irregular use of conferencing platforms. Moreover, reviewing and updating security policies for video conferencing tools, along with implementing strict network access controls, can help mitigate potential risks associated with such advanced evasion methods. Training staff to recognize unusual meeting activities or credentials use can also be beneficial in identifying potential C2 activities.
