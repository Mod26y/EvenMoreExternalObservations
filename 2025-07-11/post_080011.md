1) What happened:
Microsoft updated Windows 11, starting from version 24H2, to replace its default scripting engine, JScript, with the JScript9Legacy engine. The change targets improving security against web-based threats such as cross-site scripting (XSS) while also enhancing performance. JScript, dating back to 1996, was a compliance and security risk due to being outdated. The new engine, JScript9Legacy, provides better alignment with modern security standards while maintaining support for legacy scripting needs.

2) Why it matters:
This move by Microsoft represents a significant enhancement in Windows 11â€™s security posture, reducing vulnerability to common web threats such as XSS and arbitrary code execution. By modernizing the scripting engine, Microsoft mitigates risks presented by the outdated JScript engine, which previously exposed users to various exploits through malicious documents and sites. This update signals Microsoft's focus on proactively addressing vulnerabilities and signifies a broader industry trend toward enhancing system security postures in response to evolving cyber threats.

3) What actions should be taken:
Organizations and users should ensure Windows 11 is updated to the latest version to benefit from enhanced security offered by JScript9Legacy. IT teams should verify critical applications and scripts for compatibility with the new engine. In cases of compatibility issues, contacting Microsoft support for a rollback to the old engine may be necessary. Cybersecurity teams should remain vigilant, auditing scripts and applications to confirm they are not inadvertently reverting to legacy technologies that could introduce vulnerabilities. Moreover, ongoing education about scripting language updates can help maintain robust security practices.
