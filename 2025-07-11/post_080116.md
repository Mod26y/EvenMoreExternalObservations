**What actions should be taken:** Organizations should enhance their cybersecurity posture by conducting regular risk assessments and updating their incident response plans. Implementing advanced threat detection and response mechanisms, along with employee training programs, can bolster defenses against similar attacks. It is also advisable for companies to engage in threat intelligence sharing within their industry to understand emerging threats and devise strategies for collective resilience against ransomware and other cyber threats. Additionally, reviewing and reinforcing data backup and recovery procedures can help in maintaining service continuity if an attack occurs.
