In this article, China-linked APT24, a known advanced persistent threat (APT) group, has been utilizing a new malware called BadAudio in espionage campaigns since 2022. They used sophisticated methods like spearphishing, supply-chain compromises, and watering hole attacks to deliver the malware. APT24 targeted over 20 legitimate public websites and compromised a digital marketing company, distributing malicious content across more than 1,000 domains. BadAudio was heavily obfuscated to avoid detection, used DLL search order hijacking for execution, and facilitated further payload delivery, including Cobalt Strike Beacon in some cases.

This development is significant because it highlights the capability of APT24 to conduct long-term espionage while remaining largely undetected, posing a severe threat to both public and private sectors globally. The sophisticated techniques used in these attacks, such as supply-chain compromise and the use of legitimate cloud services for distribution, represent a challenge to traditional security measures, emphasizing the need for improved vigilance and advanced defensive strategies.

Given these insights, organizations should enhance their security posture by adopting a multi-layered defense strategy, focusing on monitoring and threat intelligence. Security teams could prioritize enhancing email filtering systems to better detect spearphishing attempts and extend the inspection of supply chain components to identify potential compromises. Regular security awareness training for employees could also mitigate the risk of spearphishing while deploying endpoint detection and response solutions may help detect and contain malware like BadAudio. Additionally, considering the use of advanced cybersecurity tools that can recognize obfuscated code might improve the detection and prevention capabilities against sophisticated APT tactics.
