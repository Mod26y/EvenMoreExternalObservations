### 1) What happened

There has been a significant surge in malicious scanning activity targeting Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect VPN login portals, with a 40x increase in activities in just 24 hours beginning November 14, 2025. GreyNoise, a real-time intelligence company, reported the activity as reaching its highest level in 90 days within a week. This spike in scanning, primarily originating from AS200373 in Germany and AS208885, is indicative of a coordinated campaign potentially preceding new vulnerability disclosures. GreyNoise also noted a historical pattern where scanning increases often precede the revealing of new security flaws.

### 2) Why it matters

This surge in scanning activity is an early warning signal of potential vulnerabilities being actively sought or potentially new exploits for existing systems. Especially concerning is the pattern of such scanning often preceding announcements of unpatched security flaws, posing a substantial risk to organizations reliant on Palo Alto's security products. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and significant disruptions to business operations. Organizations running Palo Alto Networks systems, especially GlobalProtect, should be on alert, as these exploratory probes indicate an increased likelihood of subsequent attacks.

### 3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information

Organizations should immediately enhance monitoring around GlobalProtect VPN portals, focusing on detecting unusual activity. It's crucial to apply all known patches and updates to Palo Alto Network products to mitigate vulnerabilities, particularly given the high correlation between scanning surges and future security disclosures. Security teams should also consider geofencing and blocking known malicious IPs and ASNs identified in the reports. Proactive threat hunting and using threat intelligence to stay updated on similar patterns will further bolster defenses. Lastly, regular security audits and penetration testing can help identify and rectify any potential weaknesses in the current setup.
