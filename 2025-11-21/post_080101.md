**What happened:** Salesforce is investigating a data theft incident connected to its platform through external Gainsight-published applications. Unauthorized activity potentially allowed access to some Salesforce customer data via a compromised app connection. The issue didn't originate within Salesforce itself but through OAuth token theft from a prior Salesloft breach. This breach laid the groundwork for the current incident, involving groups like ShinyHunters, notorious for their extortion tactics. Salesforce has taken corrective action by revoking access and tokens related to these applications, notifying affected clients, and removing the app from the AppExchange for further examination.

**Why it matters:** This breach highlights the ongoing risk of third-party applications as potential entry points for cyber threats. Salesforce is a widely used CRM platform, and unauthorized data access can lead to intellectual property theft and customer trust loss. This situation also underscores the importance of security around OAuth tokens, which can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Companies using Salesforce or similar platforms need to evaluate their third-party integrations regularly to safeguard against similar vulnerabilities.

**What actions should be taken:** Organizations should review and secure all third-party applications connected to their systems, emphasizing the protection and monitoring of OAuth tokens. It's crucial to implement best practices for API security and periodically audit third-party app permissions. Affected customers should follow Salesforce's guidance, seek additional support if needed, and monitor their systems for unusual activity. Developing a response plan for potential breaches and conducting regular employee training on spotting and reporting suspicious activities can enhance overall security posture.
