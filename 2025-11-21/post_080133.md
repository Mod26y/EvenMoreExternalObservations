1) The article discusses a new cybersecurity threat involving the "Matrix Push" command-and-control (C2) tool. This tool hijacks browser notifications as part of a phishing campaign. By exploiting this method, attackers can deliver malicious notifications that trick users into clicking harmful links or downloading malware. These attacks leverage the trust users place in browser notifications, making it easier for cybercriminals to breach systems and steal sensitive information.

2) This issue is significant because browser notifications are ubiquitous and often trusted by users, making them a potent vector for phishing attacks. Hijacking this communication channel can bypass traditional security measures, allowing attackers to infiltrate systems more effectively. This threat highlights the evolving tactics of cybercriminals and the constant need for updated security protocols to protect users and organizations from sophisticated phishing schemes and potential data breaches.

3) Organizations should consider measures to educate users about the risks of browser notifications and scrutinize the sources of such communications. Implementing robust security protocols that monitor and block suspicious notification activities can mitigate these threats. Additionally, organizations may look into enabling features that restrict browser notification permissions to only trusted sources, thus reducing potential attack surfaces for malicious actors. Regularly updating anti-phishing and anti-malware solutions is also advisable to ensure comprehensive protection against evolving cyber threats.
