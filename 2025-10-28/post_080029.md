1) What happened: The article details a notable decrease in the number of organizations paying ransoms to cybercriminals, dropping to 23% by the third quarter of 2025. This trend has been ongoing for six years, driven by improved security measures and increased pressure not to pay ransoms. Despite ransomware groups evolving by shifting focus to data theft as well as encryption, the overall payment rates continue to fall. This change is also accompanied by a reduction in average and median ransom amounts paid, as enterprises increasingly prioritize defense upgrades over compliance with ransom demands.

2) Why it matters: The decline in ransom payments indicates progress in cybersecurity practices and a shift in how organizations manage ransomware threats. This trend is meaningful as it constrains the financial incentives for cybercriminals, reducing their operational sustainability. It reflects positively on the collective efforts of cybersecurity teams, law enforcement, and policy influencers aiming to dissuade the payment of ransoms. Understanding these dynamics is critical for stakeholders in developing future strategies and measures to combat ransomware, underscoring an adaptive threat landscape that requires continuous vigilance.

3) What actions should be taken: County security teams should capitalize on the momentum by strengthening ransomware prevention and response strategies. This includes investing in rigorous anti-ransomware defenses, such as advanced monitoring and data protection measures. Continuous employee training on recognizing social engineering and phishing threats can also reduce vulnerability. Collaboration with law enforcement and information-sharing networks is advisable to stay informed on emerging threats. Evaluating and reinforcing incident response plans and encouraging a no-pay policy will further contribute to reducing ransomware profitability and prevalence.
