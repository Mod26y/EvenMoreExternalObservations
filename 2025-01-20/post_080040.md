**1) What happened:** The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took action against General Motors (GM) and OnStar for unlawfully collecting and selling drivers' precise geolocation and driving behavior data without explicit consumer consent. GM sold this data to third-party organizations, impacting insurance rates and coverage decisions. Following its investigation, the FTC has proposed a settlement that would prohibit GM and OnStar from sharing such data for five years, require them to obtain consent before data collection, and necessitate improvements in data transparency and handling.

**2) Why it matters:** This event exemplifies growing concerns over the privacy and protection of consumer data. With vehicle technology increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems, vehicle data can be used perilously, affecting everything from privacy invasion to insurance eligibility. The FTCâ€™s action signals a cautionary tale for other corporations that may engage in similar practices and highlights the necessity for robust regulatory frameworks to protect consumer privacy in an era of ubiquitous data collection.

**3) What actions should be taken:** Organizations should prioritize reviewing and tightening their data collection and handling practices to ensure compliance with regulatory standards, thereby avoiding legal repercussions. Businesses could benefit from developing transparent data use policies, obtaining explicit consumer consent, and enabling consumers to easily access and control their data. Beyond compliance, companies might consider implementing data minimization strategies to collect only essential information. Engaging public relations efforts to regain consumer trust can also be invaluable in maintaining brand integrity and customer loyalty.
