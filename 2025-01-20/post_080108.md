On the heels of the recent disclosure of a new authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-55591), dated configuration and VPN credentials for over 15,000 Fortinet devices were leaked on the Dark Web. This data, which originated from a previous vulnerability (CVE-2022-40684), exposes extensive sensitive information such as configurations, IP addresses, usernames, passwords, management certificates, and VPN credentials. This leak underscores the ongoing impact of vulnerabilities, even those perceived as outdated, and highlights the importance of addressing and mitigating vulnerabilities across their entire lifecycle.

This incident matters because it exposes critical security configurations and credentials, potentially allowing threat actors to gain unauthorized access to organizational networks, perform administrative operations, or develop further exploitation techniques. The leaked information reveals internal network configurations and outdated credentials that may still be in use, posing a significant threat even years after the initial vulnerabilities. The wide distribution of affected devices across various countries emphasizes the global scale and risk of this exposure, making it a pressing concern for organizations utilizing Fortinet products.

In response, organizations should consider conducting comprehensive reviews of their Fortinet device configurations and verify if they have been impacted by the CVE-2022-40684 vulnerability. Immediate actions could include refreshing security credentials, updating and patching devices, and reinforcing security policies for strong, regularly updated passwords. Furthermore, reviewing internal network structures and firewall rules for potential exposure could be beneficial, as would engaging in threat hunting activities to detect any signs of unauthorized access or activity. Fortinet users are also encouraged to follow best security practices and stay updated with advisories to mitigate potential future risks effectively.
