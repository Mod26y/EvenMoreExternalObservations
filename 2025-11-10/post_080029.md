**1) What happened?**

The Swiss National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued a warning about a phishing scheme targeting iPhone owners. Scammers claim to have found lost or stolen iPhones and send phishing texts, or smishing attempts, seemingly from Apple’s Find My team. These messages include accurate details about the device, urging users to click a link to view the device’s location. However, the link redirects to a phishing page that mimics Apple’s Find My website to steal the victim’s Apple ID credentials, which can then be used to bypass Apple’s Activation Lock and gain control over the device.

**2) Why it matters?**

This phishing scheme is significant because it exploits the anxiety and hope of individuals who have lost their iPhones, using their personal information to create seemingly credible scams. By obtaining Apple ID credentials, attackers can disable the Activation Lock, a vital security feature that prevents unauthorized access and resale of iPhones. This kind of attack highlights the importance of users’ awareness and cautiousness regarding suspicious messages, as well as the potential risk to personal data and device security when losing a smartphone.

**3) What actions should be taken as a result of this information?**

To mitigate the risk, users should be cautious of unsolicited messages and avoid clicking on links or entering credentials on non-official websites. It is advisable to use a dedicated email address for contact information on a lost device’s lock screen. Activating Lost Mode via the Find My app or iCloud.com/find immediately after losing a device is crucial to securing it. Additionally, protecting the SIM card with a PIN can prevent its misuse. Users should remember that Apple will not contact them via SMS or email regarding found devices, ensuring they avoid falling for these phishing scams.
