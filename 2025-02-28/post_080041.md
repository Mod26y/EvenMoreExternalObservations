**1) What happened:**

In early 2025, Modat researchers discovered that over 49,000 Access Management Systems (AMS) were misconfigured and exposed online across various industries and countries. These security systems, which manage building access through biometrics, ID cards, and license plates, were found to be insecurely configured, enabling unauthorized access. The exposure risked sensitive data, including personal identification and biometric data, along with work schedules and access logs. In some cases, researchers could even modify employee records, highlighting severe vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized physical access to critical infrastructures such as government buildings, power stations, and water treatment facilities.

**2) Why it matters:**

The exposure of AMS is of significant concern because it pertains to both cybersecurity and physical security. Unauthorized access to facilities poses risks to critical infrastructure, which could have dire repercussions. Furthermore, exposure of sensitive employee data increases the risk of phishing and social engineering attacks. In critical sectors, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of such data is crucial to prevent potential breaches that could lead to severe disruptions, financial losses, or even compromise national security. This incident underlines the vital need for secure configurations of AMS to safeguard both data privacy and physical security.

**3) What actions should be taken:**

Organizations should immediately review the security configurations of their Access Management Systems, ensuring these systems are offline or secured with firewalls and VPNs to restrict unauthorized access. Implementing multi-factor authentication, regularly updating software and firmware, and changing default credentials can significantly enhance security. Encrypted storage of biometric data and personally identifiable information (PII) should be standard, while deactivating old accounts can prevent unauthorized access. Organizations should also consider regular security audits and training for staff to detect and respond to potential vulnerabilities effectively, thereby minimizing the risk of future exposures.
